 CATHERINE: You died a week ago. 
 ROBERT: H f Q T f t 
 CATHERINE: That's why Claire's flying in from New York. 11 RO BERT. Yes.

 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 HAL: Champagne, huh? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 HAL: Celebrating? 
 CATHERINE: No. I just like champagne. 
 HAL: It's festive. 
 CATHERINE: What? 
 HAL: Festive. (e) 
 CATHERINE: Do you want some? 
 HAL: Sure. 
 CATHERINE: (e) I'm done. You can rake the rest with you. 
 HAL: Oh. No thanks. 
 CATHERINE: Take it, I'm done. 
 HAL: No, I shouldn't. I'm driving. (b) 12 Well. I can ler myself out. 
 CATHERINE: Good. 
 HAL: When should I come back? 
 CATHERINE: Come back? 
 HAL: Yeah. I'm nowhere near finished. Maybe tomorrow? 
 CATHERINE: We have a funeral tomorrow. 
 HAL: God, you're right, I'm sorry. I was going to attend, if that's all right. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 HAL: What about Sunday? Will you be around? 
 CATHERINE: You've had three days. 
 HAL: I'd love to get in some more time up there. 
 CATHERINE: How much longer do you need? 
 HAL: Another week. At least. 
 CATHERINE: Are you joking? 
 HAL: No. Do you know how much stuff there is? 
 CATHERINE: A week? 
 HAL: I know you don't need anybody in your hair right now. Look, I spent the last couple days getting everything sorted out. It's mostly notebooks. He dated them all; now that I've got them in order I don't have to work here. I could take some stuff home, read it, bring it back. 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 HAL: I'll be careful. 
 CATHERINE: My father wouldn't want anything moved and 1 don't want anything to leave this house. 
 HAL: Then I should work here. I'll stay out of the way. 
 CATHERINE: You're wasting your time. 
 HAL: Someone needs to go through your dad's papers. 
 CATHERINE: There's nothing up there. It's garbage. 
 HAL: There are a hundred and three notebooks. 
 CATHERINE: I've looked at those. It's gibberish. 
 HAL: Someone should read them. 
 CATHERINE: He was crazy. 
 HAL: Yes, but he wrote them. 
 CATHERINE: He was a graphomaniac, Harold. Do you know what that is? 
 HAL: I know. He wrote compulsively. Call me Hal. 13 
 CATHERINE: There's no connection between the ideas. There's no ideas. It's like a monkey at a typewriter. One hundred and three notebooks full of bullshit. 
 HAL: Let's make sure they're bullshit. 
 CATHERINE: I'm sure. 
 HAL: I'm prepared to look at every page. Are you? 
 CATHERINE: No. I'M not crazy. (b) 
 HAL: Well, I'm gonna be late ... Some friends of mine are in chis ban1. They're playing at a bar up on Diversey. Way down the bill, they’re probably going on around two, two-thirty. I said I'd be there. 
 CATHERINE: Great. 
 HAL: They're all in the math department. They're really good. They have this great song, you'd like it, called "i" - lowercase I. They just stand there and don't play anything for three minutes. 
 CATHERINE: "Imaginary Number." 
 HAL: It's a math joke. You see why they're way down the bill. 
 CATHERINE: Long drive to see some nerds in a band. 
 HAL: God I hate when people say that. It is not that long a drive. 
 CATHERINE: So they are nerds. 
 HAL: Oh they're raging geeks. But they're geeks who, you know, can dress themselves ... hold down a job at a major university ... Some of them have switched from glasses co contacts. They play sports, they play in a band, they get laid surprisingly often, so in that sense they sort of make you question the whole set of terms - geek, nerd, wonk, dweeb, Dilbert, paste-eater. 
 CATHERINE: You're in this band, aren't you? 
 HAL: Okay, yes. I play drums. You want to come? I never sing, I swear to God. 
 CATHERINE: No thanks. 
 HAL: All right. Look, Catherine, Monday: What do you say? 
 CATHERINE: Don't you have a job? 
 HAL: Yeah, I have a full teaching load this quarter plus my own work. 
 CATHERINE: Plus band practice. 
 HAL: I don't have time to do this but I'm going to. If you'll let me. (b) I loved your dad. I don't believe a mind like his can just shut down. He had lucid 14 moments. He had a lucid year, a whole year four years ago. 
 CATHERINE: It wasn't a year. It was more like nine months. 
 HAL: A school year. He was advising students ... I was stalled on my Ph.D. I was this dose to quitting. I met with your dad and he put me on the right track with my research. I owe him. 
 CATHERINE: Sorry. 
 HAL: Look. Let me - You're twenty-five, right? 
 CATHERINE: How old are you? 
 HAL: It doesn't matter. Listen: 
 CATHERINE: Fuck you, how old are you? 
 HAL: I'm twenty-eight, all right? When your dad was younger than both of us he made major contributions to three fields: game theory, algebraic geometry, and nonlinear operator theory. Most of us never get our heads around one. He basically invented the mathematical techniques for studying rational behavior, and he gave the astrophysicists plenty to work over too. Okay? 
 CATHERINE: Don't lecture me. 
 HAL: I'm not. I'm telling you if I came up with one-tenth of the shit your dad produced I could write my own ticket to any math department in the country. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Give me your backpack. 
 HAL: What? 
 CATHERINE: Give me your backpack. 
 HAL: Why? 
 CATHERINE: I want to look inside it. 
 HAL: What? 
 CATHERINE: Open it and give it to me. 
 HAL: Oh come on. 
 CATHERINE: You're not taking anything out of this house. 
 HAL: I wouldn't do that. 
 CATHERINE: You're hoping to find something upstairs that you can publish. 
 HAL: Sure. 
 CATHERINE: Then you can write your own ticket. 
 HAL: What? No! It would be under your dad's name. It would be for your dad. 
 CATHERINE: I don't believe you. You have a notebook in that 15 backpack. 
 HAL: What are you talking about? 
 CATHERINE: Give it to me. 
 HAL: You're being a little bit paranoid. 
 CATHERINE: PARANOID? 
 HAL: Maybe a little. 
 CATHERINE: Fuck you, 
 HAL: I KNOW you have one of my notebooks. 
 HAL: I think you should calm down and think about what you're saying. 
 CATHERINE: I'm saying you're lying to me and stealing my family's property. 
 HAL: And I think that sounds paranoid. 
 CATHERINE: Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean there isn't something in that backpack. 
 HAL: You just said yourself there's nothing up there. Didn't you? 
 CATHERINE: I - 
 HAL: Didn't you say that? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 HAL: So what would I take? Right? (b) 
 CATHERINE: You're right. 
 HAL: Thank you. 
 CATHERINE: So you don't need to come back. 
 HAL: (e) (e) (e) (b) Hey! Oh come on. Give me a break. (e) This isn't an airport. (e) (b) (b) 
 HAL: The University health service is, uh, very good. My Mom died a couple years ago and I was pretty broken up. Also my work wasn't going that well ... I went over and talked to this doctor. I saw her for a couple months and it really helped. 
 CATHERINE: I'm fine. (b) 
 HAL: Also exercise is great. 1 run along the lake a couple of mornings a week. It's not too cold yet. If you wanted to come sometime I could pick you up. We wouldn't have to talk ... 
 CATHERINE: No thanks. 
 HAL: All right. I'm gonna be late for the show. I better go. 
 CATHERINE: Okay. (b) 
 HAL: It's seriously like twenty minutes up to the club. We go on, we play, we're terrible but we buy everyone drinks afterward to make up for it. You're home by four, four-thirty, tops ... 
 CATHERINE: Good night. 
 HAL: Good night. (e) 
 CATHERINE: Wait, your coat. 
 HAL: No, you [don't have to.] - (e) (b) 
 CATHERINE: I'm PARANOID? 
 HAL: Wait. 
 CATHERINE: You think I should go JOGGING? 18 
 HAL: Just hold on. 
 CATHERINE: Get out! 
 HAL: Can I please just - 
 CATHERINE: Get the fuck out of my house. 
 HAL: Listen to me for a minute. . 
 CATHERINE: (e) You stole this! 
 HAL: Let me explain! 
 CATHERINE: You stole it from ME, you stole It from my FATHER - (e) (e) 
 HAL: Don't. Look, I borrowed the book, all right? I’m sorry, I just picked it up before I came downstairs and thought I’d 
 CATHERINE: (e) Hello? 
 HAL: I did it for a reason. 
 CATHERINE: Hello, Police? I - Yes, I'd like to report a robbery in progress. . 
 HAL: I noticed something - something your father wrote. All right? Not math, something he wrote. Here, let me show you. 
 CATHERINE: A ROBBERY. 
 HAL: Will you put the fucking phone down and listen to me? 
 CATHERINE: (e) Yes, I'm at 5724 South - . , 
 HAL: It's about you. See? YOU. It was written about you. Here’s your name: CATHY. See? . . 
 CATHERINE: South ... (e) 
 HAL: "A good day. Some very good news from Catherine." . I didn't know what that referred co, but I thought you [might]••• 
 CATHERINE: When did he write this? 
 HAL: I think four years ago. The handwriting is steady. It must have been during his remission. There's more. (e) "Machinery not working yet but I am patient." . . . "The machinery" is what he called his mind, his ability to do mathematics. 19 
 CATHERINE: I know. 
 HAL: (e) (e) I thought you might want to see it. I shouldn't have tried to sneak it out. Tomorrow I was going to - it sounds stupid now. I was going to wrap it. Happy birthday. (e) 
 CATHERINE: Shit. Fade 20 Scene 2 The next morning. Claire, stylish, attractive, drinks coffee from a mug. She has brought bagels and fruit out to the porch on a tray. She notices the champagne bottle lying on the floor. She picks it up and sets it on a table. Catherine enters. Her hair ·is wet from a shower. 
 CLAIRE: Better. Much. CATHERJNE. Thanks. 
 CLAIRE: Feel better? 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. 
 CLAIRE: You look a million times better. Have some coffee. CATHERJNE. Okay. 
 CLAIRE: How do you take it? 
 CATHERINE: Black. 
 CLAIRE: Have a little milk. (e) Want a banana? It's a good thing I brought food: There was nothing in the house. CATHERJNE. I've been meaning to go shopping. 
 CLAIRE: Have a bagel. 
 CATHERINE: No. I hate breakfast. (b) 
 CLAIRE: You didn't put on the dress. CATHERJNE. Didn't really feel like it. 
 CLAIRE: Don't you want to try it on? See if it fits? CATHERJNE. I'll put it on later. (b) 
 CLAIRE: If you want to dry your hair I have a hair drier. 
 CATHERINE: Nah. 
 CLAIRE: Did you use that conditioner I brought you? 
 CATHERINE: No, shit, I forgot. 
 CLAIRE: It's my favorite. You'll love it, Katie. I want you to try it. 
 CATHERINE: I'll use it next rime. 
 CLAIRE: You'll like it. It has jojoba. CATHERJNE. What is "jojoba"? 
 CLAIRE: It's something they put in for healthy hair. 21 
 CATHERINE: Hair is dead. 
 CLAIRE: What? 
 CATHERINE: It's dead tissue. You can't make it "healthy." 
 CLAIRE: Whatever, it's something that's good for your hair. 
 CATHERINE: What, a chemical? 
 CLAIRE: No, it's organic. 
 CATHERINE: Well it can be organic and still be a chemical. 
 CLAIRE: I don't know what it is. 
 CATHERINE: Haven't you ever heard of organic chemistry? 
 CLAIRE: It makes my hair feel, look, and smell good. That's the extent of my information about it. You might like it if you decide to use it. 
 CATHERINE: Thanks, I'll try it. 
 CLAIRE: Good. If the dress doesn't fit we can go downtown and exchange it. 
 CATHERINE: Okay. 
 CLAIRE: I'll take you to lunch. 
 CATHERINE: Great. 
 CLAIRE: Maybe Sunday before I go back. Do you need anything? 
 CATHERINE: Like clothes? 
 CLAIRE: Or anything. While I'm here. 
 CATHERINE: Nah, I'm cool. (b) 
 CLAIRE: I thought we'd have some people over tonight. If you're feeling okay. 
 CATHERINE: I'm feeling okay, Claire, stop saying that. 
 CLAIRE: You don't have any plans? 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 CLAIRE: I ordered some food. Wine, beer. 
 CATHERINE: We are burying Dad this afternoon. 
 CLAIRE: I think it will be all right. Anyone who's been to the funeral and wants to come over for something to eat, can. And it's the only time I can see any old Chicago friends. It'll be nice. It's a funeral but we don't have to be completely grim about it. If it's okay with you. 
 CATHERINE: Yes, sure. 
 CLAIRE: It's been a stressful rime. It would be good to relax in a low-key way. 22 Mitch says hi. 
 CATHERINE: Hi, Mitch. 
 CLAIRE: He's really sorry he couldn't come. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah, he's gonna miss all the fun. 
 CLAIRE: He wanted to see you. He sends his love. I told him you'd see him soon enough. We're getting married. 
 CATHERINE: No shit. 
 CLAIRE: Yes! We just decided. 
 CATHERINE: Yikes. 
 CLAIRE: Yes! 
 CATHERINE: When? 
 CLAIRE: January. 
 CATHERINE: Huh. 
 CLAIRE: We're not going to do a huge thing. His folks are gone too. Just City Hall, then a big dinner at our favorite restaurant for all our friends. And you, of course, I hope you'll be in rhe wedding. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. Of course. Congratulations, Claire, I'm really happy for you. 
 CLAIRE: Thanks, me coo. We just decided it was time. His job is great. I just got promoted ... 
 CATHERINE: Huh. 
 CLAIRE: You will come? 
 CATHERINE: Yes, sure. January? I mean I don't have to check my calendar or anything. Sure. 
 CLAIRE: That makes me very happy. (b) How are you? 
 CATHERINE: Okay. 
 CLAIRE: How are you feeling about everything? 
 CATHERINE: About "everything"? 
 CLAIRE: About Dad. 
 CATHERINE: What about him? 
 CLAIRE: How are you feeling about his death? Are you all right? 
 CATHERINE: Yes, I am. 
 CLAIRE: Honestly? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: I think in some ways it was the "right time." If there is ever a right time. Do you know what you want to do now? 23 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 CLAIRE: Do you want to stay here? 
 CATHERINE: I don't know. 
 CLAIRE: Do you want to go back to school? 
 CATHERINE: I haven't thought about it. 
 CLAIRE: Well there's a lot to think about. How do you feel? 
 CATHERINE: Physically? Great. Except my hair seems kind of unhealthy, I wish there were something I could do about that. 
 CLAIRE: Come on, Catherine. 
 CATHERINE: What is the point of all these questions? (b) 
 CLAIRE: Katie, some policemen came by while you were in the shower. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah? 
 CLAIRE: They said they were "checking up" on things here. Seeing how everything was this morning. 
 CATHERINE: (e) (b) (b) (e) (b) (e) This was sitting right here. Who were you drinking champagne with? (e) 
 CATHERINE: With no one. 
 CLAIRE: Are you sure? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. (b) 
 CLAIRE: The police said you were abusive. They said you're lucky they didn't haul you in. 
 CATHERINE: These guys were assholes, Claire. They wouldn't go away. They wanted me to fill out a report ... 
 CLAIRE: Were you abusive? 
 CATHERINE: This one cop kept spitting on me when he talked. Ir was disgusting. 
 CLAIRE: Did you use the word "dickhead"? 
 CATHERINE: Oh I don't remember. 
 CLAIRE: Did you tell one cop . . . to go fuck the other cop's mother? 
 CATHERINE: NO. 
 CLAIRE: That's what they said. 
 CATHERINE: Not with that phrasing. 
 CLAIRE: Did you strike one of them? 
 CATHERINE: They were trying to come in the house! 26 
 CLAIRE: Oh my God. 
 CATHERINE: I might have pushed him a little. 
 CLAIRE: They said you were either drunk or disturbed. 
 CATHERINE: They wanted to come in here and SEARCH MY 
 CLAIRE: YOU called THEM. 
 CATHERINE: Yes but I didn't actually WANT them to come. But they did come and then they started acting. like they owned the place pushing me around, calling me girly, smirking at me, laughing: They were assholes. . 
 CLAIRE: These guys seemed perfectly nice. They were off-duty and they took the trouble to come back her~ at the end of their shift co check up on you. They were very polite. 
 CATHERINE: Well people are nicer to you. (b) 
 CLAIRE: Katie. Would you like co come to New York? 
 CATHERINE: Yes, I told you, I'll come in January. 
 CLAIRE: You could come sooner. We'd love to have you. You could stay with us. It'd be fun. 
 CATHERINE: I don't want to. 
 CLAIRE: Mitch has become an excellent cook. It's like his hobby now. He buys all these gadgets. Garlic press olive oil sprayer • • • Every night there's something new. Delicious, wonderful meals. The other day he made vegetarian chili! 
 CATHERINE: What the fuck are you talking about? 
 CLAIRE: Stay with us for a while. We would have so much fun. 
 CATHERINE: Thanks, I'm okay here. 
 CLAIRE: Chicago is dead. New York is so much more fun, you can't believe it. 
 CATHERINE: The "fun" thing is really not where my focus is at the moment. 
 CLAIRE: I think New York would be a really fun and ... safe. place for you to - 
 CATHERINE: I don't need a safe place and I don't want to have any fun! I'm perfectly fine here. 
 CLAIRE: You look tired. I think you could use some downtime. 
 CATHERINE: Downtime? 
 CLAIRE: Kacie, please. You've had a very hard time. 
 CATHERINE: I'm PERFECTLY OKAY. 27 
 CLAIRE: I think you're upset and exhausted. 
 CATHERINE: I was FINE till you got here. 
 CLAIRE: Yes, but you - 
 HAL: (e) Catherine? 
 CLAIRE: Who is that? (e) 
 HAL: Hey, I - (e) 
 CATHERINE: HAROLD DOBBS! 
 HAL: (e) (b) (e) I'm Claire. Catherine's sister. 
 HAL: Oh, hi. Hal. Nice to meet you. (e) I ... hope it's not too early. I was just going to try to get some work done before the uh - if uh, if ... 
 CLAIRE: Yes! 
 CATHERINE: Sure, okay. (e) 
 CLAIRE: That's Harold Dobbs? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: He's cute. 
 CATHERINE: (e) (b) (e) Fade 28 Scene 3 Night. Inside the house a party is in progress. Loud 1:1usi~ from a not-very-good but enthusiastic band. Catherine ts alone on the porch. She wears a flattering black dress. Inside, the band finishes a number. Cheers, applause. After a moment Hal comes out. He wears a dark suit. He has taken off his tie. He is sweaty and revved-up from playing. He holds two bottles of beer. Catherine regards him. A beat. 
 CATHERINE: I feel that for a funeral reception this might have gotten a bit out of control. 
 HAL: Aw come on. It's great. Come on in. 
 CATHERINE: I'm okay. 
 HAL: We're done playing, I promise. 
 CATHERINE: No, thanks. 
 HAL: Do you want a beer? 
 CATHERINE: I'm okay. 
 HAL: I brought you one. (b) She . 
 CATHERINE: Okay. (e) How many people are m there? 
 HAL: It's down to about forty. 
 CATHERINE: Forty? 
 HAL: Just the hard-core partyers. 
 CATHERINE: My sister's friends. 
 HAL: No mathematicians. Your sister's friends left hours ago. The guys were really pleased to be asked to participate. They worshiped your dad. 
 CATHERINE: It was Claire's idea. 
 HAL: It was good. 
 CATHERINE: (e) (e) Sorry, it's not my place to ~ 
 CATHERINE: No, you're right. Everything was better than I thought. (b) 
 HAL: You look great. 
 CATHERINE: (e) Claire gave it to me. 
 HAL: I like it. 
 CATHERINE: It doesn't really fir. 
 HAL: No, Catherine, it's good. (e) 
 CATHERINE: When do you think they'll leave? 
 HAL: No way to know. Mathematicians are insane. I went to this conference in Toronto last fall. I'm young, right? I'm in shape, I thought I could hang with the big boys. Wrong. I've never been so exhausted in my life. Forty-eight straight hours of partying, drinking, drugs, papers, lectures ... 
 CATHERINE: Drugs? 
 HAL: Yeah. Amphetamines, mostly. I mean I don't. Some of the older guys are really hooked. 
 CATHERINE: Really? 
 HAL: Yeah, they think they need it. 
 CATHERINE: Why? 
 HAL: They think math's a young man's game. Speed keeps them racing, makes them feel sharp. There's this fear that your creativity peaks around twenty-three and it's all downhill from there. Once you hit fifty it's over, you might as well teach high school. 
 CATHERINE: That's what my father thought. 
 HAL: I dunno. Some people stay prolific. 
 CATHERINE: Not many. 
 HAL: No, you're right. Really original work - it's all young guys. 
 CATHERINE: Young guys. 
 HAL: Young people. 
 CATHERINE: But it is men, mostly. 
 HAL: There are some women. 
 CATHERINE: Who? 
 HAL: There's a woman at Stanford, I can't remember her name. 
 CATHERINE: Sophie Germain. 30 
 HAL: Yeah? I've probably seen her at meetings, I just don't chink I've met her. 
 CATHERINE: She was born in Paris in 1776. (b) 
 HAL: So I've definitely never met her. 
 CATHERINE: She was crapped in her house. The French Revolution was going on, the Terror. She had to stay inside for safety and she passed the time reading in her father's study. The Greeks ... Lacer she tried to get a real education bur the schools didn't allow women. So she wrote letters. She wrote to Gauss. She used a man's name. Uh, "Antoine-August Blanc." She sent him some proofs involving a certain kind of prime number, important work. was delighted to correspond with such a brilliant young man. Dad gave me a book about her. 
 HAL: I'm stupid. Sophie Germain, of course. 
 CATHERINE: You know her? 
 HAL: Germain Primes. 
 CATHERINE: Right. 
 HAL: They're famous. Double them and add one, and you get another prime. Like two. Two is prime, doubled plus one is five: also prime.

 HAL: (e) (b) (e) I memorized it ... (e) 
 HAL: Sorry. I'm a little drunk. 31 
 CATHERINE: It's okay. (e) I'm sorry about yesterday. I wasn't helpful. About the work you're doing. Take as long as you need upstairs. 
 HAL: You were fine. I was pushy. 
 CATHERINE: I was awful. 
 HAL: No. My timing was terrible. Anyway, you're probably right. 
 CATHERINE: What? 
 HAL: About it being junk. 
 CATHERINE: (e) (e) (b) (e) Maybe. I don't know. 
 CATHERINE: So what do you do? All you guys. (b) Is she flirting with him? Hal is not 
 HAL: Well we are scientists. 
 CATHERINE: So? 
 HAL: So there's a lot of experimentation. 
 CATHERINE: (e) (b) 
 HAL: Huh. 
 CATHERINE: That was nice. 
 HAL: Really? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 HAL: Again? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. (e) (e) (e) (e) Fade Scene 4 The next morning. Catherine alone on the porch, in a robe. Hal enters, half-dressed. He walks up behind her quietly. She hears him and turns. 
 HAL: How long have you been up? 
 CATHERINE: A while. 
 HAL: Did I oversleep? 
 CATHERINE: No. (b) Morning-after 
 HAL: Is your sister up? 
 CATHERINE: No. She's flying home in a couple hours. I should probably wake her. 
 HAL: Let her sleep. She was doing some pretty serious drinking with the theoretical physicists last night. 
 CATHERINE: I'll make her some coffee when she gets up. (b) 
 HAL: Sunday mornings I usually go out. Get the paper, have some breakfast. 
 CATHERINE: Okay. (b) 
 HAL: Do you want to come? 34 
 CATHERINE: Oh. No. I ought to stick around until Claire leaves. 
 HAL: AH right. Do you mind if I stay? 
 CATHERINE: No. You can work if you want. 
 HAL: (e) Okay. 
 CATHERINE: Okay. 
 HAL: Should I? 
 CATHERINE: If you want to. 
 HAL: Do you want me to go? 
 CATHERINE: Do you want to go? 
 HAL: I wane to stay here with you. 
 CATHERINE: Oh ... 
 HAL: I want to spend the day with you if possible. ,I'd like to spend as much time with you as I can unless of course I’m coming on way too strong right now and scaring you in which case I’ll begin backpedaling immediately . . . (e) (e) Here. 
 HAL: What's this? 
 CATHERINE: It's a key. 
 HAL: Ah. 
 CATHERINE: Try it. 
 HAL: Where? 
 CATHERINE: Bottom drawer of the desk in my dad's office. 
 HAL: What's in there? 
 CATHERINE: There's one way to find out, Professor. 
 HAL: Now? (e) (e) 
 CATHERINE: Good morning. 35 
 CLAIRE: Please don't yell please. 
 CATHERINE: Are you all right? 
 CLAIRE: No. (b) She clutches her Those fucking physicists. 
 CATHERINE: What happened? 
 CLAIRE: Thanks a lot for leaving me all alone with them. 
 CATHERINE: Where were your friends? 
 CLAIRE: My stupid friends left - it was only eleven o'clock! - they all had to get home and pay their babysitters or bake bread or something. I'm left alone with these lunatics ... 
 CATHERINE: Why did you drink so much? 
 CLAIRE: I thought I could keep up with them. I thought they'd stop. They didn't. Oh God. 
 CATHERINE: Do you want some coffee? 
 CLAIRE: In a minute. That BAND. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. 
 CLAIRE: They were terrible. 
 CATHERINE: They were okay. They had fun. I think. 
 CLAIRE: Well as long as everyone had fun. Your dress turned om all right. 
 CATHERINE: I love it. 
 CLAIRE: You do. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah, it's wonderful. 
 CLAIRE: I was surprised you even wore it. 
 CATHERINE: I love it, Claire. Thanks. 
 CLAIRE: (e) (e) It's no trouble. 
 CLAIRE: Hold on a sec, Katie. I just ... (e) I'm leaving soon. I 
 CATHERINE: You said. I know. 36 
 CLAIRE: I'd still like you to come to New York. 
 CATHERINE: Yes: January. 
 CLAIRE: I'd like you to move to New York. 
 CATHERINE: Move? 
 CLAIRE: Would you think about it? For me? You could stay with me and Mitch at first. There's plenty of room. Then you could get your own place. I've already scoured some apartments for you, really cute places. 
 CATHERINE: What would I do in New York? 
 CLAIRE: What are you doing here? 
 CATHERINE: I live here. 
 CLAIRE: You could do whatever you want. You could work, you could go to school. 
 CATHERINE: I don't know, Claire. This is pretty major. 
 CLAIRE: I realize that. 
 CATHERINE: I know you mean well. I'm just not sure what I want to do. 1 mean to be honest you were right yesterday. I do feel a little confused. I'm tired. It's been a pretty weird couple of years. I think I'd like to take some time to figure things out. 
 CLAIRE: You could do that in New York. 
 CATHERINE: And I could do it here. 
 CLAIRE: But it would be much easier for me to get you set up in an apartment in New York, and - 
 CATHERINE: I don't need an apartment, I'll stay in the house. 
 CLAIRE: We're selling the house. (b) 
 CATHERINE: What? 
 CLAIRE: We - I'm selling it. 
 CATHERINE: WHEN? 
 CLAIRE: I'm hoping to do the paperwork this week. I know it seems sudden. 
 CATHERINE: No one was here looking at the place, who are you selling it to? 
 CLAIRE: The University. They've wanted the block for years. 
 CATHERINE: I LIVE HERE. 
 CLAIRE: Honey, now that Dad's gone it doesn't make sense. It's in bad shape. It costs a fortune to heat. It's time to let it go. Mitch agrees, it's a very smart move. We're lucky, we have a great offer - 
 CATHERINE: Where am I supposed to live? 37 
 CLAIRE: Come to New York. 
 CATHERINE: I can't believe this. 
 CLAIRE: It'll be so good. You deserve a change. This would be a whole new adventure for you. 
 CATHERINE: Why are you doing this? 
 CLAIRE: I want to help. 
 CATHERINE: By kicking me out of my house? 
 CLAIRE: It was my house too. 
 CATHERINE: You haven't lived here for years. 
 CLAIRE: I know that. You were on your own. I really regret that, Clarie. 
 CATHERINE: Don't. 
 CLAIRE: I know I let you down. I feel awful about it. Now I'm trying to help. 
 CATHERINE: You want to help now? 
 CLAIRE: Yes. 
 CATHERINE: Dad is dead. 
 CLAIRE: I know. 
 CATHERINE: He's dead. Now that he's dead you fly in for the weekend and decide you want to help? YOU'RE LATE. Where have you been? 
 CLAIRE: I -- 
 CATHERINE: Where were you five years ago? You weren't helping then. 
 CLAIRE: I was working. 
 CATHERINE: I was HERE. I lived with him ALONE. 
 CLAIRE: I was working fourteen-hour days. I paid every bill here. I paid off the mortgage on this three-bedroom house while I was living in a studio in Brooklyn. 
 CATHERINE: You had your life. You got to finish school. 
 CLAIRE: You could have stayed in school! 
 CATHERINE: How? 
 CLAIRE: I would have done anything - I told you that. I told you a million times to do anything you wanted. 
 CATHERINE: What about Dad? Someone had to take care of him. 
 CLAIRE: He was ill. He should have been in a full-time professional care situation. 
 CATHERINE: He didn't belong in the outhouse. 38 
 CLAIRE: He might have been better off. 
 CATHERINE: How can you say that? 
 CLAIRE: This is where I'm meant to feel guilty, right? 
 CATHERINE: Sure, go for it. 
 CLAIRE: I'm heartless. My own father. 
 CATHERINE: He needed to be here. In his own house, near the University, near his students, near everything that made him happy. 
 CLAIRE: Maybe. Or maybe some real, professional care would have done him more good than rattling around in a filthy house with YOU looking after him. I'm sorry, Catherine, it's not your fault. It's my fault for letting you do it. 
 CATHERINE: I was right to keep him here. 
 CLAIRE: No. 
 CATHERINE: What about his remission? Four years ago. He was healthy for almost a year. 
 CLAIRE: And then he went right downhill again. 
 CATHERINE: He might have been worse in a hospital. 
 CLAIRE: And he MIGHT have been BETTER. Did he ever do any work again? 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 CLAIRE: NO. And you might have been better. 
 CATHERINE: (e) Better than what? 
 CLAIRE: Living here with him didn't do you any good. You said that yourself. You had so much talent ... 
 CATHERINE: You think I'm like Dad. 
 CLAIRE: I think you have some of his talent and some of his tendency toward ... instability. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Claire, in addition to the "cute apartments" that you've "scouted" for me in New York, would you by any chance also have devoted some of your considerable energies toward scouting out another type of - 
 CLAIRE: NO. 
 CATHERINE: - living facility for your bughouse little sister? 
 CLAIRE: NO! Absolutely not. That is not what this is about. 39 
 CATHERINE: Don't lie to me, Claire, I'm smarter than you. (b) CLAJRE. The resources ... I've investigated - 
 CATHERINE: Oh my GOD. CLAJRE. - if you WANTED to, all I'm saying is the doctors in New York and the people are the BEST, and they - 
 CATHERINE: FUCK YOU. CLAJRE. It would be entirely up to you. You wouldn't LIVE anywhere, you can - 
 CATHERINE: I hate you. 
 CLAIRE: Don't yell, please, calm down. 
 CATHERINE: I HATE YOU. I - (e) (b) (e) 
 HAL: How long have you known about this? 
 CATHERINE: A while. 
 HAL: Why didn't you tell me about it? 
 CATHERINE: I wasn't sure I wanted to. (b) 
 HAL: Thank you. 
 CATHERINE: You're welcome. CLAJRE. What's going on? 
 HAL: God, Catherine, thank you. 
 CATHERINE: I thought you'd like to see it. CLAJRE. What is it? 
 HAL: It's incredible. CLAJRE. What IS it? 
 HAL: Oh, uh, it's a result. A proof. I mean it looks like one. I mean it is one, a very long one, I haven't read it all of course, or checked it, I don't even know if I could check it, but if it IS what I think it is a proof of, it's a very ... IMPORTANT ... proof CLAJRE. What does it prove? 
 HAL: It looks like it proves a theorem ... a mathematical theorem about prime numbers, something mathematicians have been trying to prove since ... since there were mathematicians, basically. Most people thought it couldn't be done. 
 CLAIRE: Where did you find it? 
 HAL: In your father's desk. Cathy told me about it. 40 
 CLAIRE: You know what this is? 
 CATHERINE: Sure. CLAJRE. Is it good? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 HAL: It's historic. If it checks out. 
 CLAIRE: What does it say? 
 HAL: I don't know yet. I've just read the first few pages. 
 CLAIRE: Bur what does it mean? 
 HAL: It means chat during a time when everyone thought your dad was crazy . . . or barely functioning . . . he was doing some of the most important mathematics in the world. If it checks out it means you publish instantly. It means newspapers all over the world are going to want to talk to the person who found this notebook. 
 CLAIRE: Cathy. 
 HAL: Cathy. 
 CATHERINE: I didn't find it. 
 HAL: Yes you did. 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 CLAIRE: Well did you find it or did Hal find it? 
 HAL: I didn't find it. 
 CATHERINE: I didn't find it. I wrote it. Curtain 41 ACT TWO

 HAL: You wrote this? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: When? 
 CATHERINE: I started after I quit school. I finished a few months before Dad died. 
 CLAIRE: Did he see it? 
 CATHERINE: No. He didn't know I was working on it. It wouldn't have mattered to him anyway, he was too sick. 
 HAL: I don't understand - you did this by yourself? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: in Dad's notebook. 
 CATHERINE: I used one of his blank books. There were a bunch of them upstairs. (b) 
 CLAIRE: (e) Tell me exactly where you found this? 
 HAL: In his study. 
 CATHERINE: In his desk. I gave him the - 
 CLAIRE: (e) Hold on. (e) Where did you find it? 
 HAL: In the bottom drawer of the desk in the study, a locked drawer: Catherine gave me the key. 
 CLAIRE: Why was the drawer locked? . . 
 CATHERINE: It's mine, it's the drawer I keep my private dungs in. I've used it for years. 
 CLAIRE: (e) Was there anything else in the drawer? 
 HAL: No. 
 CATHERINE: No, that's the only - 
 CLAIRE: Can I see it? (e) (b) (e) The book was m the 51 ... You told him where to find it ... You gave him the key ... You wrote this incredible thing and you didn't tell anyone? 
 CATHERINE: I'm telling you both now. After I dropped out of school I had nothing to do. I was depressed, really depressed, but at a certain point I decided Fuck it, I don't need them. It's just math, I can do it on my own. So I kept working here. I worked at night, after Dad had gone to sleep. It was hard but I did it. (b) 
 CLAIRE: Catherine, I'm sorry, but I just find this very hard to believe. 
 CATHERINE: Claire. I wrote. The proof 
 CLAIRE: I'm sorry, I - 
 CATHERINE: Claire ... 
 CLAIRE: This is Dad's handwriting. 
 CATHERINE: It's not. 
 CLAIRE: It looks exactly like it. 
 CATHERINE: It's my writing. 
 CLAIRE: I'm sorry - 
 CATHERINE: Ask Hal. He's been looking at Dad's writing for weeks. (e) (b) (b) 
 CLAIRE: I think - you know what? I think it's early, and people are tired, and not in the best state to make decisions about emotional things, so maybe we should all just take a breath ... 
 CATHERINE: You don't believe me? 
 CLAIRE: I don't know. I really don't know anything about this. 
 CATHERINE: Never mind. I don't know why I expected you to believe me about ANYTHING. 
 CLAIRE: Could you tell us the proof? That would show it was yours. 
 CATHERINE: You wouldn't understand it. 
 CLAIRE: Tell it to Hal. 
 CATHERINE: (e) We could talk through it together. It might take a while. 52 
 CLAIRE: (e) You can't use the book. 
 CATHERINE: For God's sake, it's forty pages long. I didn't MEMORIZE it. It's not a muffin recipe. (b) This is stupid. It's my book, my writing, my key, my drawer, my proof. Hal, tell her! 
 HAL: Tell her what? 
 CATHERINE: Whose book is that? 
 HAL: I don't know. 
 CATHERINE: What is the matter with you? You've been looking at his other stuff, you know there's nothing even remotely like this! 
 HAL: Look, Catherine 
 CATHERINE: We'll go through the proof together. We'll sit down - if Claire will please let me have my book back - 
 CLAIRE: (e) (b) (b) At least it looks an awful lot like the writing in the other books. Maybe your writing looks exactly like his, I don't know.

 CLAIRE: Don't worry, I understand. It's very sweet you want to see Catherine but of course you'd like to see the notebook too. 
 HAL: (e) (e) 
 CLAIRE: Hal. 
 HAL: Yeah? 
 CLAIRE: Can you tell me about it? The proof. I'm just curious. 
 HAL: It would take some time. How much math have you got? (b) 
 CLAIRE: I'm a currency analyst. It helps to be very quick with numbers. I am. I probably inherited about one-one-thousandth of my father's ability. It's enough. Catherine got more, I'm not sure how much. Fade Scene 4 Winter. About three and a half years earlier. Robert is on the porch. He wears a T-shirt. He writes in a notebook. Afte1· a moment we hear Catherine's voice from off.

The months of cold equal November through February. are four months of cold, and four of hear, leaving four months of indeterminate temperature. In February it snows. In March the Lake is a lake of ice. In September the students come back and the bookstores are full. X equal the month of full bookstores. The number of books approaches infinity as the number of months of cold approaches four. I will never be as cold now as I will in the future. The future of cold is infinite. The future of heat is the future of cold. The bookstores are infinite and so are never full except in September ... " (e) It's all right. We'll go inside. 
 ROBERT: I c 
 CATHERINE: We'll warm you up. (e) 
 ROBERT: D l P 
 CATHERINE: I won't. Let's go inside. Fade 63 Scene 5 The present. A week after the events in Scene 3. Claire on the porch. Coffee in takeout cups. Claire takes a plane ticket out of her purse, checks the itinerary A moment. Catherine enters with bags for travel. Claire gives her a cup of coffee. Catherine drinks in silence. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Good coffee. 
 CLAIRE: It's all right, isn't it? We have a place where we buy all our coffee. They roast it themselves, they have an old roaster down in the basement. You can smell it on the street. Some mornings you can smell it from our place, four stories up. It's wonderful. "Manhattan's Best": Some magazine wrote it up. Who knows. But it is very good. 
 CATHERINE: Sounds good. 
 CLAIRE: You'll like it. 
 CATHERINE: Good. (b) 
 CLAIRE: You look nice. 
 CATHERINE: Thanks, so do you. (b) 
 CLAIRE: It's bright. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: It's one of the things I do miss. All the space, the light. You could sit out here all morning. 
 CATHERINE: It's nor that warm. 
 CLAIRE: Are you cold? 
 CATHERINE: Not really. I just - 
 CLAIRE: It has gotten chilly. I'm sorry. Do you want to go in? 
 CATHERINE: I'm okay. 
 CLAIRE: I just thought it might be nice to have a quick cup of coffee out here. 
 CATHERINE: No, it is. 
 CLAIRE: Plus the kitchen's all put away. If you're cold - 
 CATHERINE: I'm not. Not really. 64 
 CLAIRE: Want your jacket? 
 CATHERINE: Yeah, okay. (e) Thanks. 
 CLAIRE: It's that time of year. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. You can feel it coming. (b) Catherine stares out at the 
 CLAIRE: Honey, there's no hurry. 
 CATHERINE: I know. 
 CLAIRE: If you want to hang our, be alone for a while - 
 CATHERINE: No. It's no big deal. 
 CLAIRE: We don't have to leave for twenty minutes or so. 
 CATHERINE: I know. Thanks, Claire. 
 CLAIRE: You're all packed. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: If you missed anything it doesn't really matter. The movers will send us everything next month. (e) (b) (b) (b) (b) (e) 
 CLAIRE: Don't come. 
 CATHERINE: No, I'm coming. 
 CLAIRE: Stay here, see how you do. 
 CATHERINE: I could. 
 CLAIRE: You can't take care of yourself for five days. 
 CATHERINE: Bullshit! 
 CLAIRE: You slept all week I had to cancel my flight. I missed a week of work - I was this close to taking you to the hospital! I couldn't believe it when you finally dragged yourself up. 
 CATHERINE: I was tired! 
 CLAIRE: You were completely out of it, Catherine, you weren't speaking! 
 CATHERINE: I didn't want to talk to you. (b) 
 CLAIRE: Stay here if you hate me so much. 
 CATHERINE: And do what? 
 CLAIRE: You're the genius, figure it out. (e) 
 HAL: You're still here. (e) I saw Claire leaving our front. I wasn't sure if you - (e) This fucking thing ... checks out. I have been over it, twice, with two different sets of guys, old geeks and young geeks. It is weird. I don't know where the techniques came from. Some of the moves are very hard to follow. But we can't find anything wrong with it! There might be something wrong with it but we can't find it. I have not slept. (e) It works. I thought you might want to know. 
 CATHERINE: I already knew. (b) 
 HAL: I had to swear these guys to secrecy. They were jumping out of their skins. See, one e-mail and it's all over. I threatened them. I think we're safe, they're physical cowards. (b) I had to see you. 
 CATHERINE: I'm leaving. 
 HAL: I know. Just wait for a minute, please? 
 CATHERINE: What do you want? You have the book. She told me you came by for it and she gave it to you. You can do whatever you want with it. Publish it. 
 HAL: Catherine. 
 CATHERINE: Get Claire's permission and publish it. She doesn't care. She doesn't know anything about it anyway. 
 HAL: I don't want Claire's permission. 
 CATHERINE: You want mine? Publish. Go for it. Have a press conference. Tell the world what my father discovered. 
 HAL: I don't want to. 
 CATHERINE: Or fuck my father, pass it off as your own work. Who cares? Write your own ticket to any math department in the country. 
 HAL: I don't think your father wrote it. (b) 
 CATHERINE: You thought so last week. 
 HAL: That was last week. I spent this week reading the proof. I think I understand it, more or less. It uses a lot of newer mathematical techniques, things that were developed in the last decade. Elliptic Curves. Modular Forms. I think I learned more mathematics this week than I did in four years of grad school. 
 CATHERINE: So? 
 HAL: So the proof is very ... hip. 
 CATHERINE: Get some sleep, Hal. 
 HAL: What was your father doing the last ten years? He wasn't well, was he? 
 CATHERINE: Are you done? 
 HAL: I don't think he would have been able to master those new techniques. 
 CATHERINE: But he was a genius. 
 HAL: But he was nuts. 
 CATHERINE: So he read about them later. 
 HAL: Maybe. The books he would have needed are upstairs. (b) Your dad dated everything. Even his most incoherent entries he dared. There are no dates in this. 
 CATHERINE: The handwriting - 
 HAL: - looks like your dad's. Parents and children sometimes have similar handwriting, especially if they've spent a lot of time together. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Interesting theory. 
 HAL: I like it. 
 CATHERINE: I like it too. It's what I told you last week. 
 HAL: I know. 
 CATHERINE: You blew it. 
 HAL: 
 CATHERINE: It's too bad, the rest of it was really good. All of it: "I loved your dad." "I always liked you." ''I'd like to spend every minute with you ... " It's killer stuff. You got laid AND you got the notebook! You're a genius! 
 HAL: I don't expect you to be happy with me. I just wanted ... I don't know. I was hoping to discuss some of this with you before you left Purely professional. I don't expect anything else. 68 
 CATHERINE: Forget it. 
 HAL: I mean we have questions. Working on this must have been amazing. I'd love just to hear you talk about some of this. 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 HAL: You'll have to deal with it eventually, you know. You can't ignore it, you'll have to get it published. You'll have to talk to someone. Take it, at least. Then I'll go. Here. 
 CATHERINE: I don't want it. 
 HAL: Come on, Catherine. I'm trying to correct things. 
 CATHERINE: You CAN'T. Do you hear me? You think you've figured something out? You run over here so pleased with yourself because you changed your mind. Now you're certain. You're so ... sloppy. You don't know anything. The book, the math, the dates, the writing, all that stuff you decided with your buddies, it's just evidence. It doesn't finish the job. It doesn't prove anything. 
 HAL: Okay, what would? 
 CATHERINE: NOTHING. You should have trusted me. (b) 
 HAL: I know. (b) Catherine gathers her So Claire sold the house? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 HAL: Stay in Chicago. You're an adult. 
 CATHERINE: She wants me in New York. She wants to look after me. 
 HAL: Do you need looking after? 
 CATHERINE: She thinks I do. 
 HAL: You looked after your dad for five years. 
 CATHERINE: So maybe it's my turn. I kick and scream but I don't know. Being taken care of, it doesn't sound so bad. I'm tired. And the house is a wreck, let's face it. It was my dad's house. I don't think I should spend another winter here. 
 HAL: There is nothing wrong with you. 
 CATHERINE: I think I'm like my dad. 
 HAL: I think you are too. 
 CATHERINE: I'm ... afraid I'm like my dad. 
 HAL: You're not him. 69 
 CATHERINE: Maybe I will be. 
 HAL: Maybe. Maybe you'll be better. (e) 
 CATHERINE: It didn't feel "amazing" or - what word did you use? 
 HAL: Yeah, amazing. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. It was just connecting the dots. Some nights I could connect three or four. Some nights they'd be really far apart, I'd have no idea how to get to the next one, if there was a next one. 
 HAL: He really never knew? 
 CATHERINE: No. I worked after midnight. He was usually in bed. 
 HAL: Every night? 
 CATHERINE: No. When I got stuck I watched TY. Sometimes if he couldn't sleep he'd come downstairs, sit with me. We'd talk. Not about math, he couldn't. About the movie we were watching. I'd explain the stories. Or about fixing the heat. Decide we didn't want to. We liked the radiators even though they clanked in the middle of the night, make the air dry. Or we'd plan breakfast, talk about what we were gonna eat together in the morning. Those nights were usually pretty good. I know ... it works ... But all I can see are the compromises, the approximations, places where it's stitched together. It's lumpy. Dad's stuff was way more elegant. When he was young. (b) 
 HAL: Talk me through it? Whatever's bothering you. Maybe you'll improve it. 
 CATHERINE: I don't know ... 
 HAL: Pick anything. Give it a shot? Maybe you'll discover something elegant. (e)
