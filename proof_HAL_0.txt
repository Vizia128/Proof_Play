ACT ONE

 ROBERT: Can't sleep? 
 CATHERINE: Jesus, you scared me. 
 ROBERT: Sorry. 
 CATHERINE: What are you doing here? 
 ROBERT: I thought I'd check up on you. Why aren't you in bed? 
 CATHERINE: Your student is still here. He's up in your study. 
 ROBERT: He can let himself out. 
 CATHERINE: I might as well wait up till he's done. 
 ROBERT: He's not my student anymore. He's teaching now. Bright kid. (b) 
 CATHERINE: What time is it? 
 ROBERT: It's almost one. 
 CATHERINE: Huh. 
 ROBERT: After midnight ... 
 CATHERINE: So? 
 ROBERT: So: (e) (e) 
 ROBERT: Twenty-five! 
 CATHERINE: I feel old. RO BERT. You're a kid. 
 CATHERINE: Glasses? 
 ROBERT: Goddamn it, I forgot the glasses. Do you want me to - 
 CATHERINE: Nah. (e) 
 ROBERT: I hope you like it. I wasn't sure what ro get you. 
 CATHERINE: This is the worst champagne I have ever tasted. 
 ROBERT: I am proud to say I don't know anything about wines. I hate those kind of people who are always talking about "vintages." 
 CATHERINE: Ir's not even champagne. 
 ROBERT: The bottle was the right shape. 
 CATHERINE: "Great Lakes Vineyards." I didn't know they made wine in Wisconsin. 
 ROBERT: A girl who's drinking from rhe bottle shouldn't complain. Don't guzzle it. It's an elegant beverage. Sip. 
 CATHERINE: (e) Do you - 
 ROBERT: No, go ahead. 
 CATHERINE: You sure? 
 ROBERT: Yeah. It's your birthday. 
 CATHERINE: Happy birthday to me. 
 ROBERT: What are you going to do on your birthday? 
 CATHERINE: Drink this. Have some. 
 ROBERT: No. I hope you're not spending your birthday alone. 
 CATHERINE: I'm not alone. 6 
 ROBERT: I don't count. 
 CATHERINE: Why not? 
 ROBERT: I'm your old man. Go out with some friends. 
 CATHERINE: Right. 
 ROBERT: Your friends aren't taking you out? 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 ROBERT: Why not? 
 CATHERINE: Because in order for your friend to take you out you generally have to have friends. 
 ROBERT: (e) (b) (e) (b) (b) (b) (e) (b) (e) Dad. . 
 ROBERT: I was. Hey, it's true. The clarity- chat was the amazing thing. No doubts. 
 CATHERINE: You were happy? 
 ROBERT: Yeah, I was busy. 
 CATHERINE: Not the same thing. 
 ROBERT: I don't see the difference. I knew what I wanted to do 9 and I did it. If I wanted to work a problem all day long, I did it. If I wanted to look for information - secrets, complex and tantalizing messages - I could find them all around me: in the air. In a pile of fallen leaves some neighbor raked together. In box scores in the paper, written in the steam coming up off a cup of coffee. The whole world was talking to me. If I just wanted to dose my eyes, sit quietly on the porch and listen for the messages, I did that. It was wonderful. (b) 
 CATHERINE: How old were you? When it started. 
 ROBERT: Mid-twenties. Twenty-three, four. (b) Is that what you're worried about? 
 CATHERINE: I've thought about it. 
 ROBERT: Just getting a year older means nothing, Catherine. 
 CATHERINE: It's not just getting older. 
 ROBERT: It's me. (b) 
 CATHERINE: I've thought about it. 
 ROBERT: Really? 
 CATHERINE: How could I not? 
 ROBERT: Well if that's why you're worried you're not keeping up with the medical literature. There are all kinds of factors. It's not simply something you inherit. Just because I went bughouse doesn't mean you will. 
 CATHERINE: Dad ... 
 ROBERT: Listen to me. Life changes fast in your early twenties and it shakes you up. You're feeling down. It's been a bad week. You've had a lousy couple years, no one knows that better than me. Bur you're gonna be okay. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah? 
 ROBERT: Yes. I promise you. Push yourself. Don't read so many magazines. Sit down and get the machinery going and I swear to God you'll feel fine. The simple fact chat we can talk about this together is a good sign. 
 CATHERINE: A good sign? 
 ROBERT: Yes! 
 CATHERINE: How could it be a good sign? 
 ROBERT: Because! Crazy people don't sit around wondering if they're nuts. 
 CATHERINE: They don't? 
 ROBERT: Of course not. They've got better things to do. Take it from me. A very good sign that you're crazy is an inability to ask the question, "Am I crazy?" 
 CATHERINE: Even if the answer is yes? 
 ROBERT: Crazy people don't ask. You see? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: So if you're asking ... 
 CATHERINE: I'm not. 
 ROBERT: But if you were, it would be a very good sign. 
 CATHERINE: A good sign ... 
 ROBERT: A good sign that you're fine. 
 CATHERINE: Right. 
 ROBERT: You see? You've just gotta think these things through. Now come on, what do you say? Let's call it a night, you go up, get some sleep, and then in the morning you can - 
 CATHERINE: Wait. No. RO BERT. What's the matter? 
 CATHERINE: It doesn't work. 
 ROBERT: Why nor? 
 CATHERINE: le doesn't make sense. 
 ROBERT: Sure it does. 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 ROBERT: Where's the problem? 
 CATHERINE: The problem is you are crazy! 
 ROBERT: What difference does that make? 
 CATHERINE: You admitted - You just told me that you are. 
 ROBERT: So? 
 CATHERINE: You said a crazy person would never admit char. 
 ROBERT: Yeah, but it's ... oh. I see. 
 CATHERINE: So? 
 ROBERT: It's a point. 
 CATHERINE: So how can you admit it? 
 ROBERT: Well. Because I'm also dead. (b) Aren't I? 
 CATHERINE: You died a week ago. 
 ROBERT: Heart failure. Quick. The funeral's tomorrow. 
 CATHERINE: That's why Claire's flying in from New York. 11 RO BERT. Yes. 
 CATHERINE: You're sitting here. You're giving me advice. You brought me champagne. 
 ROBERT: Yes. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Which means ... 
 ROBERT: For you? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: For you, Catherine, my daughter, who I love very much ... It could be a bad sign. (e) (b) (e)

 HAL: I k H w c C m H 1

 CATHERINE: Shit. Fade 20 Scene 2 The next morning. Claire, stylish, attractive, drinks coffee from a mug. She has brought bagels and fruit out to the porch on a tray. She notices the champagne bottle lying on the floor. She picks it up and sets it on a table. Catherine enters. Her hair ·is wet from a shower. 
 CLAIRE: Better. Much. CATHERJNE. Thanks. 
 CLAIRE: Feel better? 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. 
 CLAIRE: You look a million times better. Have some coffee. CATHERJNE. Okay. 
 CLAIRE: How do you take it? 
 CATHERINE: Black. 
 CLAIRE: Have a little milk. (e) Want a banana? It's a good thing I brought food: There was nothing in the house. CATHERJNE. I've been meaning to go shopping. 
 CLAIRE: Have a bagel. 
 CATHERINE: No. I hate breakfast. (b) 
 CLAIRE: You didn't put on the dress. CATHERJNE. Didn't really feel like it. 
 CLAIRE: Don't you want to try it on? See if it fits? CATHERJNE. I'll put it on later. (b) 
 CLAIRE: If you want to dry your hair I have a hair drier. 
 CATHERINE: Nah. 
 CLAIRE: Did you use that conditioner I brought you? 
 CATHERINE: No, shit, I forgot. 
 CLAIRE: It's my favorite. You'll love it, Katie. I want you to try it. 
 CATHERINE: I'll use it next rime. 
 CLAIRE: You'll like it. It has jojoba. CATHERJNE. What is "jojoba"? 
 CLAIRE: It's something they put in for healthy hair. 21 
 CATHERINE: Hair is dead. 
 CLAIRE: What? 
 CATHERINE: It's dead tissue. You can't make it "healthy." 
 CLAIRE: Whatever, it's something that's good for your hair. 
 CATHERINE: What, a chemical? 
 CLAIRE: No, it's organic. 
 CATHERINE: Well it can be organic and still be a chemical. 
 CLAIRE: I don't know what it is. 
 CATHERINE: Haven't you ever heard of organic chemistry? 
 CLAIRE: It makes my hair feel, look, and smell good. That's the extent of my information about it. You might like it if you decide to use it. 
 CATHERINE: Thanks, I'll try it. 
 CLAIRE: Good. If the dress doesn't fit we can go downtown and exchange it. 
 CATHERINE: Okay. 
 CLAIRE: I'll take you to lunch. 
 CATHERINE: Great. 
 CLAIRE: Maybe Sunday before I go back. Do you need anything? 
 CATHERINE: Like clothes? 
 CLAIRE: Or anything. While I'm here. 
 CATHERINE: Nah, I'm cool. (b) 
 CLAIRE: I thought we'd have some people over tonight. If you're feeling okay. 
 CATHERINE: I'm feeling okay, Claire, stop saying that. 
 CLAIRE: You don't have any plans? 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 CLAIRE: I ordered some food. Wine, beer. 
 CATHERINE: We are burying Dad this afternoon. 
 CLAIRE: I think it will be all right. Anyone who's been to the funeral and wants to come over for something to eat, can. And it's the only time I can see any old Chicago friends. It'll be nice. It's a funeral but we don't have to be completely grim about it. If it's okay with you. 
 CATHERINE: Yes, sure. 
 CLAIRE: It's been a stressful rime. It would be good to relax in a low-key way. 22 Mitch says hi. 
 CATHERINE: Hi, Mitch. 
 CLAIRE: He's really sorry he couldn't come. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah, he's gonna miss all the fun. 
 CLAIRE: He wanted to see you. He sends his love. I told him you'd see him soon enough. We're getting married. 
 CATHERINE: No shit. 
 CLAIRE: Yes! We just decided. 
 CATHERINE: Yikes. 
 CLAIRE: Yes! 
 CATHERINE: When? 
 CLAIRE: January. 
 CATHERINE: Huh. 
 CLAIRE: We're not going to do a huge thing. His folks are gone too. Just City Hall, then a big dinner at our favorite restaurant for all our friends. And you, of course, I hope you'll be in rhe wedding. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. Of course. Congratulations, Claire, I'm really happy for you. 
 CLAIRE: Thanks, me coo. We just decided it was time. His job is great. I just got promoted ... 
 CATHERINE: Huh. 
 CLAIRE: You will come? 
 CATHERINE: Yes, sure. January? I mean I don't have to check my calendar or anything. Sure. 
 CLAIRE: That makes me very happy. (b) How are you? 
 CATHERINE: Okay. 
 CLAIRE: How are you feeling about everything? 
 CATHERINE: About "everything"? 
 CLAIRE: About Dad. 
 CATHERINE: What about him? 
 CLAIRE: How are you feeling about his death? Are you all right? 
 CATHERINE: Yes, I am. 
 CLAIRE: Honestly? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: I think in some ways it was the "right time." If there is ever a right time. Do you know what you want to do now? 23 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 CLAIRE: Do you want to stay here? 
 CATHERINE: I don't know. 
 CLAIRE: Do you want to go back to school? 
 CATHERINE: I haven't thought about it. 
 CLAIRE: Well there's a lot to think about. How do you feel? 
 CATHERINE: Physically? Great. Except my hair seems kind of unhealthy, I wish there were something I could do about that. 
 CLAIRE: Come on, Catherine. 
 CATHERINE: What is the point of all these questions? (b) 
 CLAIRE: Katie, some policemen came by while you were in the shower. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah? 
 CLAIRE: They said they were "checking up" on things here. Seeing how everything was this morning. 
 CATHERINE: (e) (b) (b) (e) (b) (e) This was sitting right here. Who were you drinking champagne with? (e) 
 CATHERINE: With no one. 
 CLAIRE: Are you sure? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. (b) 
 CLAIRE: The police said you were abusive. They said you're lucky they didn't haul you in. 
 CATHERINE: These guys were assholes, Claire. They wouldn't go away. They wanted me to fill out a report ... 
 CLAIRE: Were you abusive? 
 CATHERINE: This one cop kept spitting on me when he talked. Ir was disgusting. 
 CLAIRE: Did you use the word "dickhead"? 
 CATHERINE: Oh I don't remember. 
 CLAIRE: Did you tell one cop . . . to go fuck the other cop's mother? 
 CATHERINE: NO. 
 CLAIRE: That's what they said. 
 CATHERINE: Not with that phrasing. 
 CLAIRE: Did you strike one of them? 
 CATHERINE: They were trying to come in the house! 26 
 CLAIRE: Oh my God. 
 CATHERINE: I might have pushed him a little. 
 CLAIRE: They said you were either drunk or disturbed. 
 CATHERINE: They wanted to come in here and SEARCH MY 
 CLAIRE: YOU called THEM. 
 CATHERINE: Yes but I didn't actually WANT them to come. But they did come and then they started acting. like they owned the place pushing me around, calling me girly, smirking at me, laughing: They were assholes. . 
 CLAIRE: These guys seemed perfectly nice. They were off-duty and they took the trouble to come back her~ at the end of their shift co check up on you. They were very polite. 
 CATHERINE: Well people are nicer to you. (b) 
 CLAIRE: Katie. Would you like co come to New York? 
 CATHERINE: Yes, I told you, I'll come in January. 
 CLAIRE: You could come sooner. We'd love to have you. You could stay with us. It'd be fun. 
 CATHERINE: I don't want to. 
 CLAIRE: Mitch has become an excellent cook. It's like his hobby now. He buys all these gadgets. Garlic press olive oil sprayer • • • Every night there's something new. Delicious, wonderful meals. The other day he made vegetarian chili! 
 CATHERINE: What the fuck are you talking about? 
 CLAIRE: Stay with us for a while. We would have so much fun. 
 CATHERINE: Thanks, I'm okay here. 
 CLAIRE: Chicago is dead. New York is so much more fun, you can't believe it. 
 CATHERINE: The "fun" thing is really not where my focus is at the moment. 
 CLAIRE: I think New York would be a really fun and ... safe. place for you to - 
 CATHERINE: I don't need a safe place and I don't want to have any fun! I'm perfectly fine here. 
 CLAIRE: You look tired. I think you could use some downtime. 
 CATHERINE: Downtime? 
 CLAIRE: Kacie, please. You've had a very hard time. 
 CATHERINE: I'm PERFECTLY OKAY. 27 
 CLAIRE: I think you're upset and exhausted.

He is sweaty and revved-up from playing. He holds two bottles of beer. Catherine regards him. A beat.

 CATHERINE: Good morning. 35 
 CLAIRE: Please don't yell please. 
 CATHERINE: Are you all right? 
 CLAIRE: No. (b) She clutches her Those fucking physicists. 
 CATHERINE: What happened? 
 CLAIRE: Thanks a lot for leaving me all alone with them. 
 CATHERINE: Where were your friends? 
 CLAIRE: My stupid friends left - it was only eleven o'clock! - they all had to get home and pay their babysitters or bake bread or something. I'm left alone with these lunatics ... 
 CATHERINE: Why did you drink so much? 
 CLAIRE: I thought I could keep up with them. I thought they'd stop. They didn't. Oh God. 
 CATHERINE: Do you want some coffee? 
 CLAIRE: In a minute. That BAND. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. 
 CLAIRE: They were terrible. 
 CATHERINE: They were okay. They had fun. I think. 
 CLAIRE: Well as long as everyone had fun. Your dress turned om all right. 
 CATHERINE: I love it. 
 CLAIRE: You do. 
 CATHERINE: Yeah, it's wonderful. 
 CLAIRE: I was surprised you even wore it. 
 CATHERINE: I love it, Claire. Thanks. 
 CLAIRE: (e) (e) It's no trouble. 
 CLAIRE: Hold on a sec, Katie. I just ... (e) I'm leaving soon. I 
 CATHERINE: You said. I know. 36 
 CLAIRE: I'd still like you to come to New York. 
 CATHERINE: Yes: January. 
 CLAIRE: I'd like you to move to New York. 
 CATHERINE: Move? 
 CLAIRE: Would you think about it? For me? You could stay with me and Mitch at first. There's plenty of room. Then you could get your own place. I've already scoured some apartments for you, really cute places. 
 CATHERINE: What would I do in New York? 
 CLAIRE: What are you doing here? 
 CATHERINE: I live here. 
 CLAIRE: You could do whatever you want. You could work, you could go to school. 
 CATHERINE: I don't know, Claire. This is pretty major. 
 CLAIRE: I realize that. 
 CATHERINE: I know you mean well. I'm just not sure what I want to do. 1 mean to be honest you were right yesterday. I do feel a little confused. I'm tired. It's been a pretty weird couple of years. I think I'd like to take some time to figure things out. 
 CLAIRE: You could do that in New York. 
 CATHERINE: And I could do it here. 
 CLAIRE: But it would be much easier for me to get you set up in an apartment in New York, and - 
 CATHERINE: I don't need an apartment, I'll stay in the house. 
 CLAIRE: We're selling the house. (b) 
 CATHERINE: What? 
 CLAIRE: We - I'm selling it. 
 CATHERINE: WHEN? 
 CLAIRE: I'm hoping to do the paperwork this week. I know it seems sudden. 
 CATHERINE: No one was here looking at the place, who are you selling it to? 
 CLAIRE: The University. They've wanted the block for years. 
 CATHERINE: I LIVE HERE. 
 CLAIRE: Honey, now that Dad's gone it doesn't make sense. It's in bad shape. It costs a fortune to heat. It's time to let it go. Mitch agrees, it's a very smart move. We're lucky, we have a great offer - 
 CATHERINE: Where am I supposed to live? 37 
 CLAIRE: Come to New York. 
 CATHERINE: I can't believe this. 
 CLAIRE: It'll be so good. You deserve a change. This would be a whole new adventure for you. 
 CATHERINE: Why are you doing this? 
 CLAIRE: I want to help. 
 CATHERINE: By kicking me out of my house? 
 CLAIRE: It was my house too. 
 CATHERINE: You haven't lived here for years. 
 CLAIRE: I know that. You were on your own. I really regret that, Clarie. 
 CATHERINE: Don't. 
 CLAIRE: I know I let you down. I feel awful about it. Now I'm trying to help. 
 CATHERINE: You want to help now? 
 CLAIRE: Yes. 
 CATHERINE: Dad is dead. 
 CLAIRE: I know. 
 CATHERINE: He's dead. Now that he's dead you fly in for the weekend and decide you want to help? YOU'RE LATE. Where have you been? 
 CLAIRE: I -- 
 CATHERINE: Where were you five years ago? You weren't helping then. 
 CLAIRE: I was working. 
 CATHERINE: I was HERE. I lived with him ALONE. 
 CLAIRE: I was working fourteen-hour days. I paid every bill here. I paid off the mortgage on this three-bedroom house while I was living in a studio in Brooklyn. 
 CATHERINE: You had your life. You got to finish school. 
 CLAIRE: You could have stayed in school! 
 CATHERINE: How? 
 CLAIRE: I would have done anything - I told you that. I told you a million times to do anything you wanted. 
 CATHERINE: What about Dad? Someone had to take care of him. 
 CLAIRE: He was ill. He should have been in a full-time professional care situation. 
 CATHERINE: He didn't belong in the outhouse. 38 
 CLAIRE: He might have been better off. 
 CATHERINE: How can you say that? 
 CLAIRE: This is where I'm meant to feel guilty, right? 
 CATHERINE: Sure, go for it. 
 CLAIRE: I'm heartless. My own father. 
 CATHERINE: He needed to be here. In his own house, near the University, near his students, near everything that made him happy. 
 CLAIRE: Maybe. Or maybe some real, professional care would have done him more good than rattling around in a filthy house with YOU looking after him. I'm sorry, Catherine, it's not your fault. It's my fault for letting you do it. 
 CATHERINE: I was right to keep him here. 
 CLAIRE: No. 
 CATHERINE: What about his remission? Four years ago. He was healthy for almost a year. 
 CLAIRE: And then he went right downhill again. 
 CATHERINE: He might have been worse in a hospital. 
 CLAIRE: And he MIGHT have been BETTER. Did he ever do any work again? 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 CLAIRE: NO. And you might have been better. 
 CATHERINE: (e) Better than what? 
 CLAIRE: Living here with him didn't do you any good. You said that yourself. You had so much talent ... 
 CATHERINE: You think I'm like Dad. 
 CLAIRE: I think you have some of his talent and some of his tendency toward ... instability. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Claire, in addition to the "cute apartments" that you've "scouted" for me in New York, would you by any chance also have devoted some of your considerable energies toward scouting out another type of - 
 CLAIRE: NO. 
 CATHERINE: - living facility for your bughouse little sister? 
 CLAIRE: NO! Absolutely not. That is not what this is about. 39 
 CATHERINE: Don't lie to me, Claire, I'm smarter than you. (b) CLAJRE. The resources ... I've investigated - 
 CATHERINE: Oh my GOD. CLAJRE. - if you WANTED to, all I'm saying is the doctors in New York and the people are the BEST, and they - 
 CATHERINE: FUCK YOU. CLAJRE. It would be entirely up to you. You wouldn't LIVE anywhere, you can - 
 CATHERINE: I hate you. 
 CLAIRE: Don't yell, please, calm down. 
 CATHERINE: I HATE YOU. I - (e) (b) (e)

Scene 1 Robert is alone on the porch. He sits quietly, enjoying the quiet, the September afternoon. A notebook nearby, unopened. He closes his eyes, apparently dozing. It is four years earlier than the events in Act One. Catherine enters quietly. She stands behind her father for a moment. 
 ROBERT: Hello. 
 CATHERINE: How did you know I was here? 
 ROBERT: I heard you. 
 CATHERINE: I thought you were asleep. 
 ROBERT: On an afternoon like this? No. 
 CATHERINE: Do you need anything? 
 ROBERT: No. 
 CATHERINE: I'm going to the store. 
 ROBERT: What's for dinner? 
 CATHERINE: What do you want? 
 ROBERT: Not spaghetti. 
 CATHERINE: All right. 
 ROBERT: Disgusting stuff. 
 CATHERINE: That's what I was going to make. 
 ROBERT: I had a feeling. Good thing I spoke up. You make it too much. 
 CATHERINE: What do you want? 
 ROBERT: What do you have a taste for? 
 CATHERINE: Nothing. RO BERT. Nothing at all? 
 CATHERINE: I don't care. I thought pasta would be easy. 
 ROBERT: Pasta, oh God don't even say the word "pasta." It 42 sounds so hopeless, like surrender: "Pasta would be easy." Yes, yes it would. Pasta. It doesn't MEAN anything. It's just a euphemism people invented when they got sick of eating spaghetti. 
 CATHERINE: Dad, what do you want to eat? 
 ROBERT: I don't know. 
 CATHERINE: Well I don't know what to get. 
 ROBERT: I'll shop. 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 ROBERT: I'll do it. 
 CATHERINE: No, Dad, rest. 
 ROBERT: I wanted to take a walk anyway. 
 CATHERINE: Are you sure? 
 ROBERT: Yes. What about a walk to the lake? You and me. 
 CATHERINE: All right. 
 ROBERT: I would love to go to the lake. Then on the way home we'll stop at the store, see what jumps out at us. 
 CATHERINE: It's warm. It would be nice, 1f you re up for it. 
 ROBERT: You're damn right I'm up for it. We'll work up an appetite. Give me ten seconds, let me put this stuff away and we're out the door. 
 CATHERINE: I'm going to school. (b) 
 ROBERT: When? 
 CATHERINE: I'm gonna start at Northwestern at the end of the month. 
 ROBERT: Northwestern? 
 CATHERINE: They were great about my credits. They're taking me in as a sophomore. I wasn't sure when to talk to you about it. 
 ROBERT: Northwestern? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: What's wrong with Chicago? 
 CATHERINE: You still teach there. I'm sorry, it's roo weird, taking classes in your department. 
 ROBERT: It's a long drive. 
 CATHERINE: Not that long, half an hour. 
 ROBERT: Still, twice a day ... 
 CATHERINE: Dad, I'd live there. (b) 
 ROBERT: You'd actually want to live in Evanston? 43 
 CATHERINE: Yes. I'll still be dose. I can come home whenever you want. You've been well - really well - for almost seven months. I don't think you need me here every minute of the day. (b) 
 ROBERT: This is. all a done deal? You're in. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: You're sure. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: Who pays for it? 
 CATHERINE: They're giving me a free ride, Dad. They've been great. 
 ROBERT: On tuition, sure. What about food, books, clothes, gas, meals out - do you plan to have a social life? 
 CATHERINE: I don't know. 
 ROBERT: You gotta pay your own way on dates, at least the early dates, say the first three, otherwise they expect something. 
 CATHERINE: The money will be fine. Claire's gonna help out. 
 ROBERT: When did you talk to Claire? 
 CATHERINE: I don't know, a couple weeks ago. 
 ROBERT: You talk to her before you talk to me? 
 CATHERINE: There were a lot of details to work out. She was great, she offered to take care of all the expenses. 
 ROBERT: This is a big step. A different city 
 CATHERINE: It's not even a long distance phone call. 
 ROBERT: It's a huge place. They're serious up there. I mean serious. Yeah the football's a disaster but the math guys don't kid around. You haven't been in school. You sure you're ready? You can get buried up there. 
 CATHERINE: I'll be all right. 
 ROBERT: You're way behind. 
 CATHERINE: I know. 
 ROBERT: A year, at least. 
 CATHERINE: Thank you, I KNOW Look, I don't know if this is a good idea. I don't know if I can handle the work. I don't know if I can handle any of it. 
 ROBERT: For Chrissake, Catherine, you should have talked to me. 
 CATHERINE: Dad. Listen. If you ever ... if for any reason it ever turned out that you needed me here full time again - 44 
 ROBERT: I WON'T. That's not [what Tm talking about.}- 
 CATHERINE: I can always take a semester off, or - 
 ROBERT: No. Stop it. I just the end of the MONTH? Why didn't you say something before? 
 CATHERINE: Dad, come on. It took a while to set this up, and until recently, until very recently, you weren't - 
 ROBERT: You just said yourself I've been fine. 
 CATHERINE: Yes, but I didn't know - I hoped, but I didn't know, no one knew if this would last. I told myself to wait until I was sure about you. That you were feeling okay again. Consistently okay. 
 ROBERT: So I'm to take this conversation as a vote of confidence? I'm honored. 
 CATHERINE: Take it however you want. I believed you'd get better. 
 ROBERT: Well thank you very much. 
 CATHERINE: Don't thank me. I had to. I was living with you. 
 ROBERT: All right, that's enough, Catherine. Let's stay on the subject. 
 CATHERINE: This is the subject! There were LIBRARY BOOKS stacked up to the ceiling upstairs, do you remember that? You were trying to decode MESSAGES - 
 ROBERT: The fucking books are gone, I took them back myself. Why do you bring that garbage up? (e) (b) 
 ROBERT: Mr. Dobbs. 
 HAL: H I h i n a b t 
 ROBERT: Yes it is, actually, you couldn't have picked worse. 
 HAL: O I u R B Y i a a 
 HAL: I s I c c b 
 ROBERT: It's all right. We needed a break 
 HAL: A y s 
 ROBERT: 'Yes. The argument was about dinner. We don't know what to eat. What's your suggestion? (e) 
 HAL: U t a g p p n t f f h 
 ROBERT: NO! 45 
 CATHERINE: {With That is a BRILLIANT idea. 
 ROBERT: Oh dear Jesus God no. 
 CATHERINE: {With What's it called? Give me the address. 
 ROBERT: No! Sorry. Wrong answer but thank you for trying. (e) 
 HAL: I c c b 
 ROBERT: Stay. (e) Where are you going? 
 CATHERINE: Inside. 
 ROBERT: What about dinner? 
 CATHERINE: What about him? 
 ROBERT: What are you doing here, Dobbs? 
 HAL: M r s I a r s 
 ROBERT: Don't be silly. 
 HAL: I c t y o 
 ROBERT: Stop. Sit down. Glad you're here. Don't let the dinner thing throw you, you'll bounce back. (e) This should be easier. Let's back off the problem, let it breathe, come at it again when it's not looking. 
 CATHERINE: Fine. (e) (e) Don't go, have a drink with us. Catherine, Harold Dobbs. 
 CATHERINE: Hi. 
 HAL: H 
 ROBERT: Hal is a grad student. He's doing his PhD, very promising stuff. Unfortunately for him his work coincided with my return to the department and he got stuck with me. 
 HAL: N n i b - I b v l 
 CATHERINE: How long have you been at U. of C.? 
 HAL: W I b w o m t f - 
 ROBERT: Hal is in our "Infinite" program. As he approaches completion of his dissertation, time approaches infinity. Would you like a drink, Hal? 
 HAL: Y I w A u w a d r . (e) 
 ROBERT: Really? (e) You must have had an interesting few months. 46 
 HAL: (e) (e) I w s i I s w t t q s o i I s g i t y n o h o d a d b I f f i I I m I j . l j g i o w s I t I j c o a s i y w h a - 
 ROBERT: Drink this.

 ROBERT: Wrong. If it feels done there are major errors. 
 HAL: U 1 
 ROBERT: Thar's okay, that's good, we'll find them and fix them. Don't worry. You're on your way to a solid career, you'll be teaching younger, more irritating versions of yourself in no rime. 
 HAL: T y 
 ROBERT: Catherine's in the math department at Northwestern, Hal. (e) 
 HAL: O w a y w w 
 CATHERINE: I'm just starting this fall. Undergrad. 
 ROBERT: She's starting in ... three weeks? 
 CATHERINE: A little more. (b) 
 ROBERT: They have some good people at Northwestern. O'Donohue. Kaminsky. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: They will work your ass off. 
 CATHERINE: I know. 
 ROBERT: You'll have to run pretty hard to catch up. 
 CATHERINE: I think I can do it. 
 ROBERT: Of course you can. (b) 
 HAL: Y m b e 
 CATHERINE: I am. 
 HAL: F y o s c b g 
 CATHERINE: Yeah? 
 HAL: S a t n p n p g o o t h 
 CATHERINE: (e) (e) (e) It's awful the way children sentimentalize their parents. (e) We could us~ some quiet around here. 
 CATHERINE: Oh don't worry, I'll come back I'll be here every Sunday cooking up big vats of spaghetti to last you through the week. 
 ROBERT: And I'll drive up, strut around Evanston, embarrass you in from of your classmates. 
 CATHERINE: Good. So we'll be in touch. RO BERT. Sure. And if you get stuck with a problem, give me a call. 
 CATHERINE: Okay. Same to you. 
 ROBERT: Fine. Make sure to get me your number. (e) I'm actually looking forward to getting some work done. 
 HAL: O w a y w o 
 ROBERT: Nothing. (b) Nothing at the moment. Which I'm glad of, really. This is the time of year when you don't want to be tied down to anything. You want to be outside. I love Chicago in September. Perfect skies. Sailboats on the water. Cubs losing. Warm, the sun still hot ... with the occasional blast of Arctic wind to keep you on your toes, remind you of winter. Students coming back, bookstores full, everybody busy. I was m a bookstore yesterday. Completely full, students buying books ... brows mg ... Students do a hell of a lot of browsing, don't they? Just browsing. You see them shuffling around with their backpacks, goofing off, taking up space. You'd call it loitering except every once in a while they pick up a book and flip the pages: "Browsing." I admire it. It's an honest way to kill an afternoon. In the back of a used bookstore, or going through a crate of Somebody’s old record albums not looking for anything, just looking, what the hell, touching the old book jackets, seeing what somebody threw om, seeing what they underlined ... maybe you find something great, like an old thriller with a painted cover from the forties, or a textbook one of your professors used when he was 48 a student - his name is written in it very carefully ... Yeah, I like it. I like watching the students. Wondering what they're gonna buy, what they're gonna read. What kind of ideas they'll come up with when they settle down and get to work ... I'm not doing much right now. It does get harder. It's a stereotype that happens to be true, unfortunately for me - unfortunately for you, for all of us. 
 CATHERINE: Maybe you'll get lucky. 
 ROBERT: Maybe I will. Maybe you'll pick up where I left off. 
 CATHERINE: Don't hold your breath. 
 ROBERT: Don't underestimate yourself. 
 CATHERINE: Any way. (b) 
 ROBERT: Another drink? Cathy? Hal? 
 CATHERINE: No thanks. 
 HAL: T I r s g g 
 ROBERT: Are you sure? 
 HAL: Y 
 ROBERT: I'll call you when I've looked at this. Don't think about it rill then. Enjoy yourself, see some movies. 
 HAL: O 
 ROBERT: You can come by my office in a week. Call it 
 HAL: T e 
 ROBERT: Yes, we'll ... (b) He turns to Catherine. I am sorry. I used to have a pretty good memory for numbers. Happy birthday. 
 CATHERINE: Thank you. 
 ROBERT: I am so sorry. I'm embarrassed. 
 CATHERINE: Dad, don't be stupid. 
 ROBERT: I didn't get you anything. 
 CATHERINE: Don't worry about it. 
 ROBERT: I'm taking you out. 
 CATHERINE: You don't have to. 
 ROBERT: We are going out. I didn't want to shop and cook Let's go to dinner. Let's get the hell out of this neighborhood. What do you want to eat? Let's go to the North Side. Or Chinatown. Or Greektown. I don't know what's good anymore. 
 CATHERINE: Whatever you want. 49 
 ROBERT: Whatever you want goddamnit, Catherine, it's your birthday. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Steak. 
 ROBERT: Steak. Yes. 
 CATHERINE: No, first beer, really cold beer. Really cheap beer. 
 ROBERT: Done. 
 CATHERINE: That Chicago beer that's watery with no flavor and you can just drink gallons of it. 
 ROBERT: They just pump the water out of Lake Michigan and bottle it. 
 CATHERINE: It's so awful. 
 ROBERT: I have a taste for it myself. 
 CATHERINE: Then the steak, grilled really black, and potatoes and creamed spinach. 
 ROBERT: I remember a place. If it's still there I think it will do the trick. 
 CATHERINE: And dessert. 
 ROBERT: That goes without saying. It's your birthday, hooray. And there's the solution to our dinner problem. Thank you for reminding me, Harold Dobbs. 
 CATHERINE: (e) We're being rude. Do you want to come? 
 HAL: O n I s 
 ROBERT: Why not? Please, come. 
 CATHERINE: Come on. (e) 
 HAL: N I c I h p T y t H b

 HAL: Y w t 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: When? 
 CATHERINE: I started after I quit school. I finished a few months before Dad died. 
 CLAIRE: Did he see it? 
 CATHERINE: No. He didn't know I was working on it. It wouldn't have mattered to him anyway, he was too sick. 
 HAL: I d u - y d t b y 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: in Dad's notebook. 
 CATHERINE: I used one of his blank books. There were a bunch of them upstairs. (b) 
 CLAIRE: (e) Tell me exactly where you found this? 
 HAL: I h s 
 CATHERINE: In his desk. I gave him the - 
 CLAIRE: (e) Hold on. (e) Where did you find it? 
 HAL: I t b d o t d i t s a l d C g m t k 
 CLAIRE: Why was the drawer locked? . . 
 CATHERINE: It's mine, it's the drawer I keep my private dungs in. I've used it for years. 
 CLAIRE: (e) Was there anything else in the drawer? 
 HAL: N 
 CATHERINE: No, that's the only - 
 CLAIRE: Can I see it? (e) (b) (e) The book was m the 51 ... You told him where to find it ... You gave him the key ... You wrote this incredible thing and you didn't tell anyone? 
 CATHERINE: I'm telling you both now. After I dropped out of school I had nothing to do. I was depressed, really depressed, but at a certain point I decided Fuck it, I don't need them. It's just math, I can do it on my own. So I kept working here. I worked at night, after Dad had gone to sleep. It was hard but I did it. (b) 
 CLAIRE: Catherine, I'm sorry, but I just find this very hard to believe. 
 CATHERINE: Claire. I wrote. The proof 
 CLAIRE: I'm sorry, I - 
 CATHERINE: Claire ... 
 CLAIRE: This is Dad's handwriting. 
 CATHERINE: It's not. 
 CLAIRE: It looks exactly like it. 
 CATHERINE: It's my writing. 
 CLAIRE: I'm sorry - 
 CATHERINE: Ask Hal. He's been looking at Dad's writing for weeks. (e) (b) (b) 
 CLAIRE: I think - you know what? I think it's early, and people are tired, and not in the best state to make decisions about emotional things, so maybe we should all just take a breath ... 
 CATHERINE: You don't believe me? 
 CLAIRE: I don't know. I really don't know anything about this. 
 CATHERINE: Never mind. I don't know why I expected you to believe me about ANYTHING. 
 CLAIRE: Could you tell us the proof? That would show it was yours. 
 CATHERINE: You wouldn't understand it. 
 CLAIRE: Tell it to Hal. 
 CATHERINE: (e) We could talk through it together. It might take a while. 52 
 CLAIRE: (e) You can't use the book. 
 CATHERINE: For God's sake, it's forty pages long. I didn't MEMORIZE it. It's not a muffin recipe. (b) This is stupid. It's my book, my writing, my key, my drawer, my proof. Hal, tell her! 
 HAL: T h w 
 CATHERINE: Whose book is that? 
 HAL: I d k 
 CATHERINE: What is the matter with you? You've been looking at his other stuff, you know there's nothing even remotely like this! 
 HAL: L C 
 CATHERINE: We'll go through the proof together. We'll sit down - if Claire will please let me have my book back - 
 CLAIRE: (e) (b) (b) At least it looks an awful lot like the writing in the other books. Maybe your writing looks exactly like his, I don't know.

 HAL: (e) (e) 
 CLAIRE: Hal.

 CLAIRE: I'm a currency analyst. It helps to be very quick with numbers. I am. I probably inherited about one-one-thousandth of my father's ability. It's enough. Catherine got more, I'm not sure how much. Fade Scene 4 Winter. About three and a half years earlier. Robert is on the porch. He wears a T-shirt. He writes in a notebook. Afte1· a moment we hear Catherine's voice from off. 
 CATHERINE: Dad? (e) What are you doing out here? ROBEKL: Working. 
 CATHERINE: It's December. It's thirty degrees. 
 ROBERT: I know. (e) 
 CATHERINE: Don't you need a coat? 
 ROBERT: Don't you think I can make that assessment for myself? 
 CATHERINE: Aren't you cold? 
 ROBERT: Of course I am! I'm freezing my ass off! 
 CATHERINE: So what are you doing out here? 
 ROBERT: Thinking! Writing! 
 CATHERINE: You're gonna freeze. 
 ROBERT: It's too hot in the house. The radiators dry our the air. Also the clanking - I can't concentrate. If the house weren't so old we'd have central air hearing but we don't so I have to come our here to get any work done. 
 CATHERINE: I'll turn off the radiators. They won't make any noise. Come inside, it isn't safe. 
 ROBERT: I'm okay. 
 CATHERINE: I've been calling. Didn't you hear the phone? 
 ROBERT: It's a distraction. 
 CATHERINE: I didn't know what was going on. I had to drive all the way down here. RO BERT. I can see that. 
 CATHERINE: I had to skip class. (e) Why don't you answer the phone? 
 ROBERT: Well I'm sorry, Catherine, but its question of pnont1es 59 and work takes priority, you know that. 
 CATHERINE: You're working? 
 ROBERT: God damnit I am working! I say "I" - the machinery. The machinery is working. Catherine, it's on full blast. All the cylinders are firing, I'm on fire. That's why I came our here, to cool off. I haven't felt like this for years. 
 CATHERINE: You're kidding. 
 ROBERT: No! 
 CATHERINE: I don't believe it. 
 ROBERT: I don't believe it either! But it's true. It started about a week ago. I woke up, came downstairs, made a cup of coffee and before I could pour in the milk it was like someone turned the LIGHT on in my head. 
 CATHERINE: Really? 
 ROBERT: Not the light, the whole POWER GRID. I LIT UP and it's like no time has passed since I was twenty-one. 
 CATHERINE: You're kidding! 
 ROBERT: No! I'm back! I'm back in touch with the source - the font, the - whatever the source of my creativity was all those years ago I'm in contact with it again. I'm SITTING on it. It's a geyser and I'm shooting right up into the air on top of it. 
 CATHERINE: My God. 
 ROBERT: I'm not talking about divine inspiration. It's not funneling down into my head and onto the page. It'll rake work to shape these things; I'm not saying it won't be a tremendous amount of work. It will be a tremendous amount of work. It's not going to be easy. But the raw material is there. It's like I've been driving in traffic and now the lanes are opening up before me and I can accelerate. I see whole landscapes - places for the work to go, new techniques, revolutionary possibilities. I'm going to get whole branches of the profession talking to each other. I - I'm sorry, I'm being rude, how's school? 
 CATHERINE: (e) Fine. - 
 ROBERT: You're working hard? 
 CATHERINE: Sure. 
 ROBERT: Faculty treating you all right? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. Dad - 
 ROBERT: Made any friends? 60 
 CATHERINE: Of course. I - 
 ROBERT: Dating? 
 CATHERINE: Dad, hold on. 
 ROBERT: No details necessary if you don't want to provide them. I'm just interested. 
 CATHERINE: School's great. I want to talk about what you're doing. 
 ROBERT: Great, let's talk. 
 CATHERINE: This work. 
 ROBERT: Yes. 
 CATHERINE: (e) ls it here? 
 ROBERT: Part of it, yes. 
 CATHERINE: Can I see it? 
 ROBERT: It's all at a very early stage. 
 CATHERINE: I don't mind. 
 ROBERT: Nothing's actually complete, to be honest. It's all in progress. I think we're talking years. 
 CATHERINE: That's okay. I don't care. Just let me see anything. 
 ROBERT: You really want to? 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: You're genuinely interested. 
 CATHERINE: Dad, of course! 
 ROBERT: Of course. It's your field. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: You know how happy that makes me. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 ROBERT: I think there's enough here to keep me working the rest of my life. Not just me. I was starting to imagine I was finished, Catherine. Really finished. Don't get me wrong, I was grateful I could go to my office, have a life, but secretly I was terrified I'd never work again. Did you know that? 
 CATHERINE: I wondered. 
 ROBERT: I was absolutely fucking terrified. Then I remembered something and a part of the terror went away. I remembered you. Your creative years were just beginning. You'd get your degree, 61 do your own work. You were just getting started. _If you hadn't gone into math that would have been all right. Claire's done well for herself. I'm satisfied with her. I'm proud of you. . I don't mean to embarrass you. It's part of the reason we have children. We hope they'll survive us, accomplish what we can't. Now that I'm back in the game I admit I've got another idea, a better one. 
 CATHERINE: What? 
 ROBERT: I know you've got your own work. I don't want you to neglect that. You can't neglect it. But I could probably use some help. Work with me. If you want to, if you can work ir out with your class schedule and everything else, I could help you with that, make some calls, talk to your teachers ... I'm getting ahead of myself. Well, Jesus, look, enough bullshit, you asked to see something. Lets start with this. I’ve roughed something out. General outline for a proof. Major result. Important. It's not finished but you can see where it's going. Let's see: (e) Here. (e) It's very rough. (e) 
 CATHERINE: Dad. Let's go inside. 
 ROBERT: The gaps might make it hard to follow. We can talk it through. 
 CATHERINE: You're cold. Let's go in. 
 ROBERT: Maybe we could work on this together. This might be a great place to start. What about it? What do you think? Let's talk it through. 
 CATHERINE: Not now. I'm cold too. It's really freezing our here. Let's go inside. 
 ROBERT: I'm telling you it's stifling in there, goddamn it. The radiators. Look, read out the first couple of lines. That's how we start: You read, and we go line by line, out loud, through the argument. if there’s a better way, a shorter way. Let's collaborate. 
 CATHERINE: No. Come on. 
 ROBERT: I've been waiting years for this. This is something I want to do. Come on, let's do some work together. 
 CATHERINE: We can't do it out here. It’s freezing cold. I'm 62 taking you in. 
 ROBERT: Not until we talk about the proof. 
 CATHERINE: No. 
 ROBERT: GODDA.\1NIT 
 CATHERINE: OPEN THE GODDAMN BOOK AND READ ME THE LINES. (b) Catherine open the book. She reads slowly, without inflection.} 
 CATHERINE: "Let X equal the quantity of all quantities of X. Let X equal the cold. It is cold in December. The months of cold equal November through February. are four months of cold, and four of hear, leaving four months of indeterminate temperature. In February it snows. In March the Lake is a lake of ice. In September the students come back and the bookstores are full. X equal the month of full bookstores. The number of books approaches infinity as the number of months of cold approaches four. I will never be as cold now as I will in the future. The future of cold is infinite. The future of heat is the future of cold. The bookstores are infinite and so are never full except in September ... " (e) It's all right. We'll go inside. 
 ROBERT: I'm cold. 
 CATHERINE: We'll warm you up. (e) 
 ROBERT: Don't leave. Please. 
 CATHERINE: I won't. Let's go inside. Fade 63 Scene 5 The present. A week after the events in Scene 3. Claire on the porch. Coffee in takeout cups. Claire takes a plane ticket out of her purse, checks the itinerary A moment. Catherine enters with bags for travel. Claire gives her a cup of coffee. Catherine drinks in silence. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Good coffee. 
 CLAIRE: It's all right, isn't it? We have a place where we buy all our coffee. They roast it themselves, they have an old roaster down in the basement. You can smell it on the street. Some mornings you can smell it from our place, four stories up. It's wonderful. "Manhattan's Best": Some magazine wrote it up. Who knows. But it is very good. 
 CATHERINE: Sounds good. 
 CLAIRE: You'll like it. 
 CATHERINE: Good. (b) 
 CLAIRE: You look nice. 
 CATHERINE: Thanks, so do you. (b) 
 CLAIRE: It's bright. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: It's one of the things I do miss. All the space, the light. You could sit out here all morning. 
 CATHERINE: It's nor that warm. 
 CLAIRE: Are you cold? 
 CATHERINE: Not really. I just - 
 CLAIRE: It has gotten chilly. I'm sorry. Do you want to go in? 
 CATHERINE: I'm okay. 
 CLAIRE: I just thought it might be nice to have a quick cup of coffee out here. 
 CATHERINE: No, it is. 
 CLAIRE: Plus the kitchen's all put away. If you're cold - 
 CATHERINE: I'm not. Not really. 64 
 CLAIRE: Want your jacket? 
 CATHERINE: Yeah, okay. (e) Thanks. 
 CLAIRE: It's that time of year. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. You can feel it coming. (b) Catherine stares out at the 
 CLAIRE: Honey, there's no hurry. 
 CATHERINE: I know. 
 CLAIRE: If you want to hang our, be alone for a while - 
 CATHERINE: No. It's no big deal. 
 CLAIRE: We don't have to leave for twenty minutes or so. 
 CATHERINE: I know. Thanks, Claire. 
 CLAIRE: You're all packed. 
 CATHERINE: Yes. 
 CLAIRE: If you missed anything it doesn't really matter. The movers will send us everything next month. (e) (b) (b) (b) (b) (e)

 CLAIRE: Stay here, see how you do. 
 CATHERINE: I could. 
 CLAIRE: You can't take care of yourself for five days. 
 CATHERINE: Bullshit! 
 CLAIRE: You slept all week I had to cancel my flight. I missed a week of work - I was this close to taking you to the hospital! I couldn't believe it when you finally dragged yourself up. 
 CATHERINE: I was tired! 
 CLAIRE: You were completely out of it, Catherine, you weren't speaking! 
 CATHERINE: I didn't want to talk to you. (b) 
 CLAIRE: Stay here if you hate me so much. 
 CATHERINE: And do what? 
 CLAIRE: You're the genius, figure it out. (e)

 CATHERINE: You CAN'T. Do you hear me? You think you've figured something out? You run over here so pleased with yourself because you changed your mind. Now you're certain. You're so ... sloppy. You don't know anything. The book, the math, the dates, the writing, all that stuff you decided with your buddies, it's just evidence. It doesn't finish the job. It doesn't prove anything.

 CATHERINE: It didn't feel "amazing" or - what word did you use? 
 HAL: Y a 
 CATHERINE: Yeah. It was just connecting the dots. Some nights I could connect three or four. Some nights they'd be really far apart, I'd have no idea how to get to the next one, if there was a next one. 
 HAL: H r n k 
 CATHERINE: No. I worked after midnight. He was usually in bed. 
 HAL: E n 
 CATHERINE: No. When I got stuck I watched TY. Sometimes if he couldn't sleep he'd come downstairs, sit with me. We'd talk. Not about math, he couldn't. About the movie we were watching. I'd explain the stories. Or about fixing the heat. Decide we didn't want to. We liked the radiators even though they clanked in the middle of the night, make the air dry. Or we'd plan breakfast, talk about what we were gonna eat together in the morning. Those nights were usually pretty good. I know ... it works ... But all I can see are the compromises, the approximations, places where it's stitched together. It's lumpy. Dad's stuff was way more elegant. When he was young. (b)
