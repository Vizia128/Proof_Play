 ROBERT: Can't sleep? 
 CATHERINE: J y s m 
 ROBERT: Sorry. 
 CATHERINE: W a y d h 
 ROBERT: I thought I'd check up on you. Why aren't you in bed? 
 CATHERINE: Y s i s h H u i y s 
 ROBERT: He can let himself out. 
 CATHERINE: I m a w w u t h d 
 ROBERT: He's not my student anymore. He's teaching now. Bright kid. (b) 
 CATHERINE: W t i i 
 ROBERT: It's almost one. 
 CATHERINE: H 
 ROBERT: After midnight ... 
 CATHERINE: S 
 ROBERT: So: (He indicates something on the table behind him: a bottle of champagne.) Happy birthday. 
 CATHERINE: D 
 ROBERT: Do I ever forget? 
 CATHERINE: T y 
 ROBERT: Twenty-five. I can't believe it. 
 CATHERINE: N c I S w h i n 
 ROBERT: It's up to you. 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: You want me to open it? 
 CATHERINE: L m L t y o a b o c o h y b a w 
 ROBERT: That was a long time ago. I resent your bringing it up. 
 CATHERINE: Y l y d l a e ( o t b) 
 ROBERT: Twenty-five! 
 CATHERINE: I f o 
 ROBERT: You're a kid. 
 CATHERINE: G 
 ROBERT: Goddamn it, I forgot the glasses. Do you want me to - 
 CATHERINE: N ( d f t b A l p R w h) 
 ROBERT: I hope you like it. I wasn't sure what ro get you. 
 CATHERINE: T i t w c I h e t 
 ROBERT: I am proud to say I don't know anything about wines. I hate those kind of people who are always talking about "vintages." 
 CATHERINE: I n e c 
 ROBERT: The bottle was the right shape. 
 CATHERINE: " L V I d k t m w i W 
 ROBERT: A girl who's drinking from rhe bottle shouldn't complain. Don't guzzle it. It's an elegant beverage. Sip. 
 CATHERINE: ( t b) D y - 
 ROBERT: No, go ahead. 
 CATHERINE: Y s 
 ROBERT: Yeah. It's your birthday. 
 CATHERINE: H b t m 
 ROBERT: What are you going to do on your birthday? 
 CATHERINE: D t H s 
 ROBERT: No. I hope you're not spending your birthday alone. 
 CATHERINE: I n a 
 ROBERT: I don't count. 
 CATHERINE: W n 
 ROBERT: I'm your old man. Go out with some friends. 
 CATHERINE: R 
 ROBERT: Your friends aren't taking you out? 
 CATHERINE: N 
 ROBERT: Why not? 
 CATHERINE: B i o f y f t t y o y g h t h f 
 ROBERT: (Dismissive.) Oh 
 CATHERINE: I f h t w 
 ROBERT: You have friends. What about that cute blonde, what was her name? 
 CATHERINE: W 
 ROBERT: She lives over on Ellis Avenue - you used to spend every minute together. 
 CATHERINE: C J 
 ROBERT: Cindy Jacobsen! 
 CATHERINE: T w i t g D H f m t F i 1 
 ROBERT: What about Claire? 
 CATHERINE: S n m f s m s A s i N Y A I d l h 
 ROBERT: I thought she was coming in. 
 CATHERINE: N t t (b) 
 ROBERT: My Advice, if you find yourself awake late at night, is to sit down and do some mathematics. 
 CATHERINE: O p 
 ROBERT: We could do some together. 
 CATHERINE: N 
 ROBERT: Why not? 
 CATHERINE: I c t o a w Y s y d w a 
 ROBERT: Yeah, thanks. You used to love it. 
 CATHERINE: N a 
 ROBERT: You knew what a prime number was before you could read. 
 CATHERINE: W n I f 
 ROBERT: (Hard.) Don't waste your talent, Catherine. (b) 
 CATHERINE: I k y s s l t 
 ROBERT: I realize you've had a difficult rime. 
 CATHERINE: T 
 ROBERT: Thar's not an excuse. Don't be lazy. 
 CATHERINE: I h b l I b t c o y 
 ROBERT: Kid, I've seen you. You sleep till noon, you eat junk, you don't work, the dishes pile up in the sink. If you go out it's to buy magazines. You come back with a stack of magazines this high - I don't know how you read that crap. And those are the good days. Some days you don't get up, you don't get out of bed. 
 CATHERINE: T a t g d 
 ROBERT: Bullshit. Those days are lost. You threw them away. And you'll never know what else you threw away with them - the work you lost, the ideas you didn't have, discoveries you never made because you were moping in your bed at four in the afternoon. (b) You know I'm right. (b) 
 CATHERINE: I l a f d 
 ROBERT: How many? 
 CATHERINE: O I d k 
 ROBERT: I bet you do. 
 CATHERINE: W 
 ROBERT: I bet you count. 
 CATHERINE: K i o 
 ROBERT: Well do you know or don't you? 
 CATHERINE: I d 
 ROBERT: Of course you do. How many days have you lost? 
 CATHERINE: A m A a m 
 ROBERT: Exactly. 
 CATHERINE: G i I d - 
 ROBERT: HOW MANY? 
 CATHERINE: T d 
 ROBERT: Exactly? 
 CATHERINE: I d k 
 ROBERT: Be precise, for Chrissake. 
 CATHERINE: I s t n t 
 ROBERT: Call it thirty-three and a quarter days. 
 CATHERINE: Y a r 
 ROBERT: You're kidding! 
 CATHERINE: N 
 ROBERT: Amazing number! 
 CATHERINE: I a d f n 
 ROBERT: Catherine, if every day you say you've lost were a year, ic would be a very interesting fucking number. 
 CATHERINE: T a a q y i n i 
 ROBERT: Stop it. You know exactly what I mean. 
 CATHERINE: () 1 w 
 ROBERT: 1,729. Great number. The smallest number expressible 
 CATHERINE: - e a t s o t c i t d w 
 ROBERT: Twelve cubed plus one cubed equals 1,729. 
 CATHERINE: A t c p n c Y w g i t y 
 ROBERT: You see? Even your depression is mathematical. Stop moping and get to work. The kind of potential you have - 
 CATHERINE: I h d a g 
 ROBERT: You're young. You've got time, 
 CATHERINE: I d 
 ROBERT: Yes. 
 CATHERINE: B t t y w m a y w f 
 ROBERT: By the time I was your age I'd already done my best work. (b) 
 CATHERINE: W a a 
 ROBERT: After what? 
 CATHERINE: A y g s 
 ROBERT: What about it? 
 CATHERINE: Y c w t 
 ROBERT: No, if anything I was sharper. 
 CATHERINE: ( c h i s l) D . 
 ROBERT: I was. Hey, it's true. The clarity- chat was the amazing thing. No doubts. 
 CATHERINE: Y w h 
 ROBERT: Yeah, I was busy. 
 CATHERINE: N t s t 
 ROBERT: I don't see the difference. I knew what I wanted to do and I did it. If I wanted to work a problem all day long, I did it. If I wanted to look for information - secrets, complex and tantalizing messages - I could find them all around me: in the air. In a pile of fallen leaves some neighbor raked together. In box scores in the paper, written in the steam coming up off a cup of coffee. The whole world was talking to me. If I just wanted to dose my eyes, sit quietly on the porch and listen for the messages, I did that. It was wonderful. (b) 
 CATHERINE: H o w y W i s 
 ROBERT: Mid-twenties. Twenty-three, four. (b) Is that what you're worried about? 
 CATHERINE: I t a i 
 ROBERT: Just getting a year older means nothing, Catherine. 
 CATHERINE: I n j g o 
 ROBERT: It's me. (b) 
 CATHERINE: I t a i 
 ROBERT: Really? 
 CATHERINE: H c I n 
 ROBERT: Well if that's why you're worried you're not keeping up with the medical literature. There are all kinds of factors. It's not simply something you inherit. Just because I went bughouse doesn't mean you will. 
 CATHERINE: D . 
 ROBERT: Listen to me. Life changes fast in your early twenties and it shakes you up. You're feeling down. It's been a bad week. You've had a lousy couple years, no one knows that better than me. Bur you're gonna be okay. 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: Yes. I promise you. Push yourself. Don't read so many magazines. Sit down and get the machinery going and I swear to God you'll feel fine. The simple fact chat we can talk about this together is a good sign. 
 CATHERINE: A g s 
 ROBERT: Yes! 
 CATHERINE: H c i b a g s 
 ROBERT: Because! Crazy people don't sit around wondering if they're nuts. 
 CATHERINE: T d 
 ROBERT: Of course not. They've got better things to do. Take it from me. A very good sign that you're crazy is an inability to ask the question, "Am I crazy?" 
 CATHERINE: E i t a i y 
 ROBERT: Crazy people don't ask. You see? 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: So if you're asking ... 
 CATHERINE: I n 
 ROBERT: But if you were, it would be a very good sign. 
 CATHERINE: A g s . 
 ROBERT: A good sign that you're fine. 
 CATHERINE: R 
 ROBERT: You see? You've just gotta think these things through. Now come on, what do you say? Let's call it a night, you go up, get some sleep, and then in the morning you can - 
 CATHERINE: W N 
 ROBERT: What's the matter? 
 CATHERINE: I d w 
 ROBERT: Why nor? 
 CATHERINE: l d m s 
 ROBERT: Sure it does. 
 CATHERINE: N 
 ROBERT: Where's the problem? 
 CATHERINE: T p i y a c 
 ROBERT: What difference does that make? 
 CATHERINE: Y a - Y j t m t y a 
 ROBERT: So? 
 CATHERINE: Y s a c p w n a c 
 ROBERT: Yeah, but it's ... oh. I see. 
 CATHERINE: S 
 ROBERT: It's a point. 
 CATHERINE: S h c y a i 
 ROBERT: Well. Because I'm also dead. (b) Aren't I? 
 CATHERINE: Y d a w a 
 ROBERT: Heart failure. Quick. The funeral's tomorrow. 
 CATHERINE: T w C f i f N Y 
 ROBERT: Yes. 
 CATHERINE: Y s h Y g m a Y b m c 
 ROBERT: Yes. (b) 
 CATHERINE: W m . 
 ROBERT: For you? 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: For you, Catherine, my daughter, who I love very much ... It could be a bad sign. (They sit together for a moment. Noise off. Hal enters, twenty-eight, semi-hip clothes. He carries a backpack and a jacket, folded He lets the door go and it bangs shut. Catherine sits up with a jolt.) 
 CATHERINE: W 
 HAL: Oh, God, sorry - Did I wake you? 
 CATHERINE: W 
 HAL: Were you asleep? (b) Robert is gone.) 
 CATHERINE: Y s m f C W a y d 
 HAL: I'm sorry. I didn't realize it had gotten so late. I'm done for the night. 
 CATHERINE: G 
 HAL: Drinking alone? (She realizes she is holding the champagne bottle. She puts it down quickly.) 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 HAL: Champagne, huh? 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 HAL: Celebrating? 
 CATHERINE: N I j l c 
 HAL: It's festive. 
 CATHERINE: W 
 HAL: Festive. (He makes an awkward party" gesture.) 
 CATHERINE: D y w s 
 HAL: Sure. 
 CATHERINE: ( h t b) I d Y c r t r w y 
 HAL: Oh. No thanks. 
 CATHERINE: T i I d 
 HAL: No, I shouldn't. I'm driving. (b) Well. I can ler myself out. 
 CATHERINE: G 
 HAL: When should I come back? 
 CATHERINE: C b 
 HAL: Yeah. I'm nowhere near finished. Maybe tomorrow? 
 CATHERINE: W h a f t 
 HAL: God, you're right, I'm sorry. I was going to attend, if that's all right. 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 HAL: What about Sunday? Will you be around? 
 CATHERINE: Y h t d 
 HAL: I'd love to get in some more time up there. 
 CATHERINE: H m l d y n 
 HAL: Another week. At least. 
 CATHERINE: A y j 
 HAL: No. Do you know how much stuff there is? 
 CATHERINE: A w 
 HAL: I know you don't need anybody in your hair right now. Look, I spent the last couple days getting everything sorted out. It's mostly notebooks. He dated them all; now that I've got them in order I don't have to work here. I could take some stuff home, read it, bring it back. 
 CATHERINE: N 
 HAL: I'll be careful. 
 CATHERINE: M f w w a m a 1 d w a t l t h 
 HAL: Then I should work here. I'll stay out of the way. 
 CATHERINE: Y w y t 
 HAL: Someone needs to go through your dad's papers. 
 CATHERINE: T n u t I g 
 HAL: There are a hundred and three notebooks. 
 CATHERINE: I l a t I g 
 HAL: Someone should read them. 
 CATHERINE: H w c 
 HAL: Yes, but he wrote them. 
 CATHERINE: H w a g H D y k w t i 
 HAL: I know. He wrote compulsively. Call me Hal. 
 CATHERINE: T n c b t i T n i I l a m a a t O h a t n f o b 
 HAL: Let's make sure they're bullshit. 
 CATHERINE: I s 
 HAL: I'm prepared to look at every page. Are you? 
 CATHERINE: N I n c (b) 
 HAL: Well, I'm gonna be late ... Some friends of mine are in chis ban1. They're playing at a bar up on Diversey. Way down the bill, they’re probably going on around two, two-thirty. I said I'd be there. 
 CATHERINE: G 
 HAL: They're all in the math department. They're really good. They have this great song, you'd like it, called "i" - lowercase I. They just stand there and don't play anything for three minutes. 
 CATHERINE: " N 
 HAL: It's a math joke. You see why they're way down the bill. 
 CATHERINE: L d t s s n i a b 
 HAL: God I hate when people say that. It is not that long a drive. 
 CATHERINE: S t a n 
 HAL: Oh they're raging geeks. But they're geeks who, you know, can dress themselves ... hold down a job at a major university ... Some of them have switched from glasses co contacts. They play sports, they play in a band, they get laid surprisingly often, so in that sense they sort of make you question the whole set of terms - geek, nerd, wonk, dweeb, Dilbert, paste-eater. 
 CATHERINE: Y i t b a y 
 HAL: Okay, yes. I play drums. You want to come? I never sing, I swear to God. 
 CATHERINE: N t 
 HAL: All right. Look, Catherine, Monday: What do you say? 
 CATHERINE: D y h a j 
 HAL: Yeah, I have a full teaching load this quarter plus my own work. 
 CATHERINE: P b p 
 HAL: I don't have time to do this but I'm going to. If you'll let me. (b) I loved your dad. I don't believe a mind like his can just shut down. He had lucid moments. He had a lucid year, a whole year four years ago. 
 CATHERINE: I w a y I w m l n m 
 HAL: A school year. He was advising students ... I was stalled on my Ph.D. I was this dose to quitting. I met with your dad and he put me on the right track with my research. I owe him. 
 CATHERINE: S 
 HAL: Look. Let me - You're twenty-five, right? 
 CATHERINE: H o a y 
 HAL: It doesn't matter. Listen: 
 CATHERINE: F y h o a y 
 HAL: I'm twenty-eight, all right? When your dad was younger than both of us he made major contributions to three fields: game theory, algebraic geometry, and nonlinear operator theory. Most of us never get our heads around one. He basically invented the mathematical techniques for studying rational behavior, and he gave the astrophysicists plenty to work over too. Okay? 
 CATHERINE: D l m 
 HAL: I'm not. I'm telling you if I came up with one-tenth of the shit your dad produced I could write my own ticket to any math department in the country. (b) 
 CATHERINE: G m y b 
 HAL: What? 
 CATHERINE: G m y b 
 HAL: Why? 
 CATHERINE: I w t l i i 
 HAL: What? 
 CATHERINE: O i a g i t m 
 HAL: Oh come on. 
 CATHERINE: Y n t a o o t h 
 HAL: I wouldn't do that. 
 CATHERINE: Y h t f s u t y c p 
 HAL: Sure. 
 CATHERINE: T y c w y o t 
 HAL: What? No! It would be under your dad's name. It would be for your dad. 
 CATHERINE: I d b y Y h a n i t b 
 HAL: What are you talking about? 
 CATHERINE: G i t m 
 HAL: You're being a little bit paranoid. 
 CATHERINE: P 
 HAL: Maybe a little. 
 CATHERINE: F y 
 HAL: I KNOW you have one of my notebooks. 
 HAL: I think you should calm down and think about what you're saying. 
 CATHERINE: I s y l t m a s m f p 
 HAL: And I think that sounds paranoid. 
 CATHERINE: J b I p d m t i s i t b 
 HAL: You just said yourself there's nothing up there. Didn't you? 
 CATHERINE: I - 
 HAL: Didn't you say that? 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 HAL: So what would I take? Right? (b) 
 CATHERINE: Y r 
 HAL: Thank you. 
 CATHERINE: S y d n t c b 
 HAL: (Sighs.) Please. Someone should know for sure whether -

 CATHERINE: B m A t e T m e p p p p l m

 HAL: He was ill. It was a tragedy. 
 CATHERINE: L t w p s n t h a d . I o h a c o n a h u e o I d o o s . I g h d 
 HAL: I understand why you'd feel that way. 
 CATHERINE: F y 
 HAL: You're right. I can't imagine dealing with that. It must have been awful. I know you 
 CATHERINE: Y d k m I w t b a I d w h a 
 HAL: (Confused) Him? I don't - 
 CATHERINE: Y I d w y h 
 HAL: Why? 
 CATHERINE: H d 
 HAL: But I'm not - 
 CATHERINE: H d I d n a p a 
 HAL: There will be others. 
 CATHERINE: W 
 HAL: You think I'm the only one? People are already working over his stuff. Someone's gonna read those notebooks. 
 CATHERINE: I d i 
 HAL: No, you - 
 CATHERINE: H m f I d i 
 HAL: You can't. 
 CATHERINE: W n 
 HAL: You don't have the math. It's all just squiggles on a page. You wouldn't know the good scuff from the junk. 
 CATHERINE: I a j 
 HAL: If it's not we can't afford to miss any through carelessness. 
 CATHERINE: I k m 
 HAL: If there were anything up there it would be pretty high17 order. It would take a professional to recognize it. 
 CATHERINE: I t I c r i 
 HAL: (Patient.) Cathy ... 
 CATHERINE: W 
 HAL: I know your dad taught you some basic stuff, bur come on. 
 CATHERINE: Y d t I c d i 
 HAL: I'm sorry: I know that you couldn't. (b) (Catherine angrily snatches his backpack.) Hey! Oh come on. Give me a break. (She opens the backpack and rifles through it.) This isn't an airport. (Catherine removes items one by one. A water bottle. Some workout clothes. An orange. Drumsticks. Nothing else. She puts everything back in and gives it back. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Y c c t (b) T a b e) 
 HAL: The University health service is, uh, very good. My Mom died a couple years ago and I was pretty broken up. Also my work wasn't going that well ... I went over and talked to this doctor. I saw her for a couple months and it really helped. 
 CATHERINE: I f (b) 
 HAL: Also exercise is great. 1 run along the lake a couple of mornings a week. It's not too cold yet. If you wanted to come sometime I could pick you up. We wouldn't have to talk ... 
 CATHERINE: N t 
 HAL: All right. I'm gonna be late for the show. I better go. 
 CATHERINE: O (b) 
 HAL: It's seriously like twenty minutes up to the club. We go on, we play, we're terrible but we buy everyone drinks afterward to make up for it. You're home by four, four-thirty, tops ... 
 CATHERINE: G n 
 HAL: Good night. (Hal starts to exit. He has forgotten his jacket.) 
 CATHERINE: W y c 
 HAL: No, you [don't have to.] - (She picks up his jacket. As she does a composition book that was folded up in the coat falls to the floor. (b) Catherine picks it up, trembling with rage.) 
 CATHERINE: I P 
 HAL: Wait. 
 CATHERINE: Y t I s g J 
 HAL: Just hold on. 
 CATHERINE: G o 
 HAL: Can I please just - 
 CATHERINE: G t f o o m h 
 HAL: Listen to me for a minute. . 
 CATHERINE: ( t b) Y s t 
 HAL: Let me explain! 
 CATHERINE: Y s i f M y s I f m F - ( s t b) 
 HAL: I want to show you something, will you calm down? 
 CATHERINE: G i b 
 HAL: Just wait a minute. 
 CATHERINE: I c t p ( p u t p a d) 
 HAL: Don't. Look, I borrowed the book, all right? I’m sorry, I just picked it up before I came downstairs and thought I’d 
 CATHERINE: ( p) H 
 HAL: I did it for a reason. 
 CATHERINE: H P I - Y I l t r a r i p . 
 HAL: I noticed something - something your father wrote. All right? Not math, something he wrote. Here, let me show you. 
 CATHERINE: A R 
 HAL: Will you put the fucking phone down and listen to me? 
 CATHERINE: ( p) Y I a 5 S - . , 
 HAL: It's about you. See? YOU. It was written about you. Here’s your name: CATHY. See? . . 
 CATHERINE: S . ( p S s t b l) 
 HAL: (Reads.) "A good day. Some very good news from Catherine." . I didn't know what that referred co, but I thought you [might]••• 
 CATHERINE: W d h w t 
 HAL: I think four years ago. The handwriting is steady. It must have been during his remission. There's more. (A moment. Catherine hangs up the phone.) "Machinery not working yet but I am patient." . . . "The machinery" is what he called his mind, his ability to do mathematics. 
 CATHERINE: I k 
 HAL: (Reads.) "I know I'll get there. I am an auto mechanic who after year~ of greasy work on a hopeless wreck turns the ignition and hears a faint cough. I am nor driving yet but there's cause for optimism. Talking with students helps. So does being outside, eating meals in restaurants, riding busses, all the activities of 'normal' life. "Most of all Cathy. The years she has lost caring for me. I almost wrote 'wasted.' Yet her refusal to let me be institutionalized - her keeping me at home, caring for me herself has certainly saved my life. Made writing this possible. Made it possible to imagine doing math again. Where does her strength come from? I can never repay her. "Today is her birthday: She is twenty-one. I'm taking her to dinner." Dated September fourth. That's tomorrow. 
 CATHERINE: I t 
 HAL: You're right. (She takes the book.) I thought you might want to see it. I shouldn't have tried to sneak it out. Tomorrow I was going to - it sounds stupid now. I was going to wrap it. Happy birthday. (Hal exits. Catherine is alone. She puts her head in her hands. She weeps. Eventually she stops, wipes her eyes. From off a police siren, drawing closer.)

 CLAIRE: Feel better? 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 CLAIRE: You look a million times better. Have some coffee. CATHERJNE. Okay. 
 CLAIRE: How do you take it? 
 CATHERINE: B 
 CLAIRE: Have a little milk. (She pours.) Want a banana? It's a good thing I brought food: There was nothing in the house. CATHERJNE. I've been meaning to go shopping. 
 CLAIRE: Have a bagel. 
 CATHERINE: N I h b (b) 
 CLAIRE: You didn't put on the dress. CATHERJNE. Didn't really feel like it. 
 CLAIRE: Don't you want to try it on? See if it fits? CATHERJNE. I'll put it on later. (b) 
 CLAIRE: If you want to dry your hair I have a hair drier. 
 CATHERINE: N 
 CLAIRE: Did you use that conditioner I brought you? 
 CATHERINE: N s I f 
 CLAIRE: It's my favorite. You'll love it, Katie. I want you to try it. 
 CATHERINE: I u i n r 
 CLAIRE: You'll like it. It has jojoba. CATHERJNE. What is "jojoba"? 
 CLAIRE: It's something they put in for healthy hair. 
 CATHERINE: H i d 
 CLAIRE: What? 
 CATHERINE: I d t Y c m i " 
 CLAIRE: Whatever, it's something that's good for your hair. 
 CATHERINE: W a c 
 CLAIRE: No, it's organic. 
 CATHERINE: W i c b o a s b a c 
 CLAIRE: I don't know what it is. 
 CATHERINE: H y e h o o c 
 CLAIRE: It makes my hair feel, look, and smell good. That's the extent of my information about it. You might like it if you decide to use it. 
 CATHERINE: T I t i 
 CLAIRE: Good. If the dress doesn't fit we can go downtown and exchange it. 
 CATHERINE: O 
 CLAIRE: I'll take you to lunch. 
 CATHERINE: G 
 CLAIRE: Maybe Sunday before I go back. Do you need anything? 
 CATHERINE: L c 
 CLAIRE: Or anything. While I'm here. 
 CATHERINE: N I c (b) 
 CLAIRE: I thought we'd have some people over tonight. If you're feeling okay. 
 CATHERINE: I f o C s s t 
 CLAIRE: You don't have any plans? 
 CATHERINE: N 
 CLAIRE: I ordered some food. Wine, beer. 
 CATHERINE: W a b D t a 
 CLAIRE: I think it will be all right. Anyone who's been to the funeral and wants to come over for something to eat, can. And it's the only time I can see any old Chicago friends. It'll be nice. It's a funeral but we don't have to be completely grim about it. If it's okay with you. 
 CATHERINE: Y s 
 CLAIRE: It's been a stressful rime. It would be good to relax in a low-key way. Mitch says hi. 
 CATHERINE: H M 
 CLAIRE: He's really sorry he couldn't come. 
 CATHERINE: Y h g m a t f 
 CLAIRE: He wanted to see you. He sends his love. I told him you'd see him soon enough. We're getting married.

 CATHERINE: Y 
 CLAIRE: Yes! 
 CATHERINE: W 
 CLAIRE: January. 
 CATHERINE: H 
 CLAIRE: We're not going to do a huge thing. His folks are gone too. Just City Hall, then a big dinner at our favorite restaurant for all our friends. And you, of course, I hope you'll be in rhe wedding. 
 CATHERINE: Y O c C C I r h f y

 CATHERINE: Y

 CATHERINE: Y 
 CLAIRE: Why? 
 CATHERINE: I t t h w b r 
 CLAIRE: But it wasn't. 
 CATHERINE: N I c m m (b)

 CATHERINE: H a m a t U o C C t f m d 
 CLAIRE: Don't get upset. I'm just trying to understand! I mean if you found out some creepy grad student was trying to take some of Dad's papers and you called the police I'd understand, and if you were our here partying, drinking with your boyfriend, I'd understand.

 CLAIRE: We need to make some decisions. But I shouldn't have tried to start first thing in the morning. I don't want an argument. (b) Maybe Hal would like a bagel? (Catherine doesn't take the hint. She exits.) Fade Scene 3 Night. Inside the house a party is in progress. Loud 1:1usi~ from a not-very-good but enthusiastic band. Catherine ts alone on the porch. She wears a flattering black dress. Inside, the band finishes a number. Cheers, applause. After a moment Hal comes out. He wears a dark suit. He has taken off his tie. He is sweaty and revved-up from playing. He holds two bottles of beer. Catherine regards him. A beat. 
 CATHERINE: I f t f a f r t m h g a b o o c

 CATHERINE: I d r f 
 HAL: No, Catherine, it's good. (A moment. Noise from inside.) 
 CATHERINE: W d y t t l 
 HAL: No way to know. Mathematicians are insane. I went to this conference in Toronto last fall. I'm young, right? I'm in shape, I thought I could hang with the big boys. Wrong. I've never been so exhausted in my life. Forty-eight straight hours of partying, drinking, drugs, papers, lectures ... 
 CATHERINE: D 
 HAL: Yeah. Amphetamines, mostly. I mean I don't. Some of the older guys are really hooked. 
 CATHERINE: R 
 HAL: Yeah, they think they need it. 
 CATHERINE: W 
 HAL: They think math's a young man's game. Speed keeps them racing, makes them feel sharp. There's this fear that your creativity peaks around twenty-three and it's all downhill from there. Once you hit fifty it's over, you might as well teach high school. 
 CATHERINE: T w m f t 
 HAL: I dunno. Some people stay prolific. 
 CATHERINE: N m

 CATHERINE: I s h c t p

 CATHERINE: N 
 HAL: The point is, that book- I'm starting to think it's the only lucid one, really. And there's no math in it. 
 CATHERINE: N 
 HAL: I mean, I'll keep reading, but if I don't find anything in a couple of days ... 
 CATHERINE: B t t d

 CATHERINE: A y o r

 CATHERINE: W w w i

 CATHERINE: E w y a c

 CLAIRE: I'd like you to move to New York. 
 CATHERINE: M 
 CLAIRE: Would you think about it? For me? You could stay with me and Mitch at first. There's plenty of room. Then you could get your own place. I've already scoured some apartments for you, really cute places.

 CLAIRE: Honey, now that Dad's gone it doesn't make sense. It's in bad shape. It costs a fortune to heat. It's time to let it go. Mitch agrees, it's a very smart move. We're lucky, we have a great offer - 
 CATHERINE: W a I s t l

 CATHERINE: S g f i 
 CLAIRE: I'm heartless. My own father. 
 CATHERINE: H n t b h I h o h n t U n h s n e t m h h 
 CLAIRE: Maybe. Or maybe some real, professional care would have done him more good than rattling around in a filthy house with YOU looking after him. I'm sorry, Catherine, it's not your fault. It's my fault for letting you do it. 
 CATHERINE: I w r t k h h 
 CLAIRE: No. 
 CATHERINE: W a h r F y a H w h f a a y 
 CLAIRE: And then he went right downhill again.

 CATHERINE: N 
 CLAIRE: NO. And you might have been better. 
 CATHERINE: ( h v u c) B t w

 HAL: Oh, uh, it's a result. A proof. I mean it looks like one. I mean it is one, a very long one, I haven't read it all of course, or checked it, I don't even know if I could check it, but if it IS what I think it is a proof of, it's a very ... IMPORTANT ... proof CLAJRE. What does it prove? 
 HAL: It looks like it proves a theorem ... a mathematical theorem about prime numbers, something mathematicians have been trying to prove since ... since there were mathematicians, basically. Most people thought it couldn't be done. 
 CLAIRE: Where did you find it? 
 HAL: In your father's desk. Cathy told me about it. 
 CLAIRE: You know what this is? 
 CATHERINE: S C I i g 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 HAL: It's historic. If it checks out. 
 CLAIRE: What does it say? 
 HAL: I don't know yet. I've just read the first few pages. 
 CLAIRE: Bur what does it mean? 
 HAL: It means chat during a time when everyone thought your dad was crazy . . . or barely functioning . . . he was doing some of the most important mathematics in the world. If it checks out it means you publish instantly. It means newspapers all over the world are going to want to talk to the person who found this notebook. 
 CLAIRE: Cathy.

 ROBERT: I would love to go to the lake. Then on the way home we'll stop at the store, see what jumps out at us. 
 CATHERINE: I w I w b n 1 y r u f i 
 ROBERT: You're damn right I'm up for it. We'll work up an appetite. Give me ten seconds, let me put this stuff away and we're out the door. 
 CATHERINE: I g t s (b)

 CATHERINE: I g s a N a t e o t m

 ROBERT: You're sure.

 ROBERT: Who pays for it? 
 CATHERINE: T g m a f r D T b g 
 ROBERT: On tuition, sure. What about food, books, clothes, gas, meals out - do you plan to have a social life? 
 CATHERINE: I d k 
 ROBERT: You gotta pay your own way on dates, at least the early dates, say the first three, otherwise they expect something. 
 CATHERINE: T m w b f C g h o 
 ROBERT: When did you talk to Claire? 
 CATHERINE: I d k a c w a 
 ROBERT: You talk to her before you talk to me? 
 CATHERINE: T w a l o d t w o S w g s o t t c o a t e 
 ROBERT: This is a big step. A different city 
 CATHERINE: I n e a l d p c 
 ROBERT: It's a huge place. They're serious up there. I mean serious. Yeah the football's a disaster but the math guys don't kid around. You haven't been in school. You sure you're ready? You can get buried up there. 
 CATHERINE: I b a r 
 ROBERT: You're way behind. 
 CATHERINE: I k 
 ROBERT: A year, at least.

 ROBERT: I WON'T. That's not what Tm talking about. 
 CATHERINE: I c a t a s o o -

 CATHERINE: T i h y w I b y g b

 CATHERINE: D t m I h t I w l w y 
 ROBERT: All right, that's enough, Catherine. Let's stay on the subject. 
 CATHERINE: T i t s T w L B s u t t c u d y r t Y w t t d M - 
 ROBERT: The fucking books are gone, I took them back myself. Why do you bring that garbage up? (Knocking, off (b) Catherine goes inside to answer the door. She returns with Hal. He carries a manila envelope. He is nervous.) 
 ROBERT: Mr. Dobbs. 
 HAL: Hi. I hope it's not a bad time. 
 ROBERT: Yes it is, actually, you couldn't have picked worse. 
 HAL: Oh, I, uh 
 ROBERT: You interrupted an argument. 
 HAL: I'm sorry. I can come back. 
 ROBERT: It's all right. We needed a break 
 HAL: Are you sure? 
 ROBERT: 'Yes. The argument was about dinner. We don't know what to eat. What's your suggestion? (A beat while Hal is on the spot.) 
 HAL: Uh, there's a good pasta place nor too far from here. 
 ROBERT: NO! 
 CATHERINE: ( R) T i a B i 
 ROBERT: Oh dear Jesus God no. 
 CATHERINE: ( R) W i c G m t a 
 ROBERT: No! Sorry. Wrong answer but thank you for trying. (Hal stands there, looking at both of them.) 
 HAL: I can come back. 
 ROBERT: Stay. (To Catherine.) Where are you going? 
 CATHERINE: I 
 ROBERT: What about dinner? 
 CATHERINE: W a h 
 ROBERT: What are you doing here, Dobbs? 
 HAL: My riming sucks. I am really sorry. 
 ROBERT: Don't be silly. 
 HAL: I'll come to your office. 
 ROBERT: Stop. Sit down. Glad you're here. Don't let the dinner thing throw you, you'll bounce back. (To Catherine.) This should be easier. Let's back off the problem, let it breathe, come at it again when it's not looking. 
 CATHERINE: F () E m 
 ROBERT: Sorry, I'm rude. Hal, this is my daughter Catherine. (To Catherine.) Don't go, have a drink with us. Catherine, Harold Dobbs. 
 CATHERINE: H 
 HAL: Hi. 
 ROBERT: Hal is a grad student. He's doing his PhD, very promising stuff. Unfortunately for him his work coincided with my return to the department and he got stuck with me. 
 HAL: No, no, it's been - I've been very lucky. 
 CATHERINE: H l h y b a U o C 
 HAL: Well I've been working on my thesis for - 
 ROBERT: Hal is in our "Infinite" program. As he approaches completion of his dissertation, time approaches infinity. Would you like a drink, Hal? 
 HAL: Yes I would. And uh, with all due respect ... (He hands Robert the envelope.) 
 ROBERT: Really? (He opens it and looks inside.) You must have had an interesting few months. 
 HAL: (Cheerfully.) Worst summer of my life. 
 ROBERT: Congratulations. 
 HAL: It's just a draft. Based on everything we talked about last spring. (Robert pours a drink. Hal babbles.) I wasn't sure if I should wait till the quarter started, or if I should give it to you now, or hold off, do another draft, but I figured fuck it I, I mean I just ... lets just get it over with, so I thought I'd just come over and see if you were home, and - 
 ROBERT: Drink this. 
 HAL: Thanks. (He drinks.) I decided, I don't know, if it feels done, maybe it is. 
 ROBERT: Wrong. If it feels done there are major errors. 
 HAL: Uh, 1- 
 ROBERT: Thar's okay, that's good, we'll find them and fix them. Don't worry. You're on your way to a solid career, you'll be teaching younger, more irritating versions of yourself in no rime. 
 HAL: Thank you. 
 ROBERT: Catherine's in the math department at Northwestern, Hal. (Catherine looks up, startled.) 
 HAL: Oh, who are you working with? 
 CATHERINE: I j s t f U 
 ROBERT: She's starting in ... three weeks? 
 CATHERINE: A l m (b) 
 ROBERT: They have some good people at Northwestern. O'Donohue. Kaminsky. 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: They will work your ass off. 
 CATHERINE: I k 
 ROBERT: You'll have to run pretty hard to catch up. 
 CATHERINE: I t I c d i 
 ROBERT: Of course you can. (b) 
 HAL: You must be excited. 
 CATHERINE: I a 
 HAL: First year of school can be great. 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 HAL: Sure, all the new people, new places, getting out of the house. 
 CATHERINE: () Y 
 HAL: (Embarrassed) Or, no, I - 
 ROBERT: Absolutely, getting the hell out of here, thank God it's about time. I'll be glad to see the back of her. '

 CATHERINE: G S w b i t 
 ROBERT: Sure. And if you get stuck with a problem, give me a call. 
 CATHERINE: O S t y 
 ROBERT: Fine. Make sure to get me your number. (To Hal) I'm actually looking forward to getting some work done. 
 HAL: Oh, what are you working on? 
 ROBERT: Nothing. (b) Nothing at the moment. Which I'm glad of, really. This is the time of year when you don't want to be tied down to anything. You want to be outside. I love Chicago in September. Perfect skies. Sailboats on the water. Cubs losing. Warm, the sun still hot ... with the occasional blast of Arctic wind to keep you on your toes, remind you of winter. Students coming back, bookstores full, everybody busy. I was m a bookstore yesterday. Completely full, students buying books ... brows mg ... Students do a hell of a lot of browsing, don't they? Just browsing. You see them shuffling around with their backpacks, goofing off, taking up space. You'd call it loitering except every once in a while they pick up a book and flip the pages: "Browsing." I admire it. It's an honest way to kill an afternoon. In the back of a used bookstore, or going through a crate of Somebody’s old record albums not looking for anything, just looking, what the hell, touching the old book jackets, seeing what somebody threw om, seeing what they underlined ... maybe you find something great, like an old thriller with a painted cover from the forties, or a textbook one of your professors used when he was a student - his name is written in it very carefully ... Yeah, I like it. I like watching the students. Wondering what they're gonna buy, what they're gonna read. What kind of ideas they'll come up with when they settle down and get to work ... I'm not doing much right now. It does get harder. It's a stereotype that happens to be true, unfortunately for me - unfortunately for you, for all of us. 
 CATHERINE: M y g l 
 ROBERT: Maybe I will. Maybe you'll pick up where I left off. 
 CATHERINE: D h y b 
 ROBERT: Don't underestimate yourself.

 ROBERT: Another drink? Cathy? Hal? 
 CATHERINE: N t 
 HAL: Thanks, I really should get going. 
 ROBERT: Are you sure? 
 HAL: Yes. 
 ROBERT: I'll call you when I've looked at this. Don't think about it rill then. Enjoy yourself, see some movies. 
 HAL: Okay. 
 ROBERT: You can come by my office in a week. Call it 
 HAL: The eleventh? 
 ROBERT: Yes, we'll ... (b) He turns to Catherine. Grave:) I am sorry. I used to have a pretty good memory for numbers. Happy birthday. 
 CATHERINE: T y 
 ROBERT: I am so sorry. I'm embarrassed. 
 CATHERINE: D d b s 
 ROBERT: I didn't get you anything. 
 CATHERINE: D w a i 
 ROBERT: I'm taking you out. 
 CATHERINE: Y d h t 
 ROBERT: We are going out. I didn't want to shop and cook Let's go to dinner. Let's get the hell out of this neighborhood. What do you want to eat? Let's go to the North Side. Or Chinatown. Or Greektown. I don't know what's good anymore. 
 CATHERINE: W y w

 CATHERINE: A d 
 ROBERT: That goes without saying. It's your birthday, hooray. And there's the solution to our dinner problem. Thank you for reminding me, Harold Dobbs.

 CLAIRE: (To Catherine.) Hold on. (To Hal.) Where did you find it? 
 HAL: In the bottom drawer of the desk in the study, a locked drawer: Catherine gave me the key. 
 CLAIRE: Why was the drawer locked? . .

 HAL: Okay. It ... okay. (b) He hands the book back.) 
 CLAIRE: I think - you know what? I think it's early, and people are tired, and not in the best state to make decisions about emotional things, so maybe we should all just take a breath ... 
 CATHERINE: Y d b m 
 CLAIRE: I don't know. I really don't know anything about this.

 HAL: You're right. Okay. Here's my suggestion. I know three or four guys at the department, very sharp, disinterested people who knew your father, knew his work. Let me rake this to them. 
 CATHERINE: W 
 HAL: I'll tell them we’ve found something, something potentially major, we're not sure about the authorship; I'll sit down with them. we'll go through the thing carefully - 
 CLAIRE: Good. 
 HAL: - and figure out exactly what we've got. It would only take a couple of days, probably, and then we'd have a lot more information. 
 CLAIRE: I think that's an excellent suggestion.

 CATHERINE: W n 
 HAL: I'm a mathematician. 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 HAL: I know how hard it would be to come up with something like this. I mean it's impossible. You'd have to be ... you'd have to be your dad, basically. Your dad at the peak of his powers.

 CLAIRE: Katie. Let's go inside. . . Katie? (Catherine opens the book and tries to rip out the pages, destroy it. Claire goes to take it from her. They struggle. Catherine gets the book away. They stand apart, breathing hard After a moment, Catherine throws the book to the floor. She exits.) Fade Scene 3 The next day. The porch is empty. Knocking, off No one appears. After a moment Hal comes around the side of the porch and knocks on the back door. 
 HAL: Catherine? (Claire enters.) I thought you were leaving. 
 CLAIRE: I had to delay my flight. (b) 
 HAL: Is Catherine here? 
 CLAIRE: I don't think this is a good time, Hal. 
 HAL: Could I see her? 
 CLAIRE: Not now. 
 HAL: What's the matter? 
 CLAIRE: She's sleeping. 
 HAL: Can I wait here until she gets up? 
 CLAIRE: She's been sleeping since yesterday. She won't o-er up. She won't eat, won't talk to me. I couldn't go home. I'm going to wait until she seems okay to travel. 
 HAL: Jesus, I'm sorry. 
 CLAIRE: Yes. 
 HAL: I'd like to talk to her. 
 CLAIRE: I don't think that's a good idea. 
 HAL: Has she said anything? 
 CLAIRE: About you? No. 
 HAL: Yesterday ... I know I didn't do what she wanted. 
 CLAIRE: Neither of us did. 
 HAL: I didn't know what to say. I feel awful. 
 CLAIRE: Why did you sleep with her? (b) 
 HAL: I'm sorry, that's none of your business. 
 CLAIRE: Bullshit. I have to take care of her. It's a little bit harder with you jerking her around. 
 HAL: I wasn't jerking her around. It just happened. 
 CLAIRE: Your timing was not great. 
 HAL: It wasn't my timing, it was both of our -- 
 CLAIRE: Why'd you do it? You know what she's like. She's fragile and you took advantage of her. 
 HAL: No. It's what we both wanted. I didn't mean to hurt her. 
 CLAIRE: You did. 
 HAL: I'd like to talk to Catherine, please. 
 CLAIRE: You can't. 
 HAL: Are you taking her away? 
 CLAIRE: Yes. 
 HAL: To New York. 
 CLAIRE: Yes. 
 HAL: Just going to drag her to New York. 
 CLAIRE: If I have to. 
 HAL: Don't you think she should have some say in whether or not she goes? 
 CLAIRE: If she's not going to speak, what else can I do? 
 HAL: Let me try. Let me talk to her. 
 CLAIRE: Hal, give up. This has nothing to do with you. 
 HAL: I know her. She's tougher than you think, Claire. 
 CLAIRE: What? 
 HAL: She can handle herself She can handle talking to me - maybe it would help. Maybe she'd like it. 
 CLAIRE: Maybe she'd like it? Are you out of your mind? You're the reason she's up there right now! You have no idea what she needs. You don't know her! She's my sister. Jesus, you fucking mathematicians: You don't think. You don't know what you're doing. You stagger around creating these catastrophes and it's people like me who end up flying in to clean them up. (b) She needs to get out of Chicago, out of this house. I'll give you my number in New York. You can call her once she's settled there. That's it, that's the deal. 
 HAL: Okay. (b) Hal doesn't move.) 
 CLAIRE: I don't mean to be rude but I have a lot to do. 
 HAL: There's one more thing. You're not going to like it. 
 CLAIRE: Sure, take the notebook. 
 HAL: (Startled.) I - 
 CLAIRE: Hold on a sec, I'll get it for you. (She goes inside and returns with the notebook. She gives it to Hal.) 
 HAL: I thought this would be harder. 
 CLAIRE: Don't worry, I understand. It's very sweet you want to see Catherine but of course you'd like to see the notebook too. 
 HAL: (Huffy) It's No, it's my responsibility- as a professional I can't turn my back on the necessity of the - 
 CLAIRE: Relax. I don't care. Take it. What would I do with it? 
 HAL: You sure? 
 CLAIRE: Yes, of course. 
 HAL: You trust me with this? 
 CLAIRE: Yes. 
 HAL: You just said I don't know what I'm doing. 
 CLAIRE: I think you're a little bit of an idiot but you're not dishonest. Someone needs to figure our what's in there. I can't do it. It should be done here, in Chicago: my father would like that. When you decide what we've got let me know what the family should do. 
 HAL: Thanks. 
 CLAIRE: Don't thank me, it's by far the most convenient option available. I put my card in there, call me whenever you want. 
 HAL: Okay. (Hai starts to exit. Claire hesitates, then:) 
 CLAIRE: Hal. 
 HAL: Yeah? 
 CLAIRE: Can you tell me about it? The proof. I'm just curious. 
 HAL: It would take some time. How much math have you got? (b) 
 CLAIRE: I'm a currency analyst. It helps to be very quick with numbers. I am. I probably inherited about one-one-thousandth of my father's ability. It's enough. Catherine got more, I'm not sure how much. Fade Scene 4 Winter. About three and a half years earlier. Robert is on the porch. He wears a T-shirt. He writes in a notebook. Afte1· a moment we hear Catherine's voice from off.

 CATHERINE: S w a y d o h 
 ROBERT: Thinking! Writing! 
 CATHERINE: Y g f 
 ROBERT: It's too hot in the house. The radiators dry our the air. Also the clanking - I can't concentrate. If the house weren't so old we'd have central air hearing but we don't so I have to come our here to get any work done.

 CATHERINE: Y w 
 ROBERT: God damnit I am working! I say "I" - the machinery. The machinery is working. Catherine, it's on full blast. All the cylinders are firing, I'm on fire. That's why I came our here, to cool off. I haven't felt like this for years. 
 CATHERINE: Y k 
 ROBERT: No! 
 CATHERINE: I d b i 
 ROBERT: I don't believe it either! But it's true. It started about a week ago. I woke up, came downstairs, made a cup of coffee and before I could pour in the milk it was like someone turned the LIGHT on in my head. 
 CATHERINE: R 
 ROBERT: Not the light, the whole POWER GRID. I LIT UP and it's like no time has passed since I was twenty-one. 
 CATHERINE: Y k 
 ROBERT: No! I'm back! I'm back in touch with the source - the font, the - whatever the source of my creativity was all those years ago I'm in contact with it again. I'm SITTING on it. It's a geyser and I'm shooting right up into the air on top of it. 
 CATHERINE: M G 
 ROBERT: I'm not talking about divine inspiration. It's not funneling down into my head and onto the page. It'll rake work to shape these things; I'm not saying it won't be a tremendous amount of work. It will be a tremendous amount of work. It's not going to be easy. But the raw material is there. It's like I've been driving in traffic and now the lanes are opening up before me and I can accelerate. I see whole landscapes - places for the work to go, new techniques, revolutionary possibilities. I'm going to get whole branches of the profession talking to each other. I - I'm sorry, I'm being rude, how's school?

 ROBERT: Dating? 
 CATHERINE: D h o 
 ROBERT: No details necessary if you don't want to provide them. I'm just interested. 
 CATHERINE: S g I w t t a w y d 
 ROBERT: Great, let's talk. 
 CATHERINE: T w 
 ROBERT: Yes. 
 CATHERINE: ( t n) l i h 
 ROBERT: Part of it, yes. 
 CATHERINE: C I s i 
 ROBERT: It's all at a very early stage. 
 CATHERINE: I d m 
 ROBERT: Nothing's actually complete, to be honest. It's all in progress. I think we're talking years. 
 CATHERINE: T o I d c J l m s a 
 ROBERT: You really want to? 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: You're genuinely interested. 
 CATHERINE: D o c 
 ROBERT: Of course. It's your field. 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: You know how happy that makes me. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Y 
 ROBERT: I think there's enough here to keep me working the rest of my life. Not just me. I was starting to imagine I was finished, Catherine. Really finished. Don't get me wrong, I was grateful I could go to my office, have a life, but secretly I was terrified I'd never work again. Did you know that? 
 CATHERINE: I w 
 ROBERT: I was absolutely fucking terrified. Then I remembered something and a part of the terror went away. I remembered you. Your creative years were just beginning. You'd get your degree, do your own work. You were just getting started. _If you hadn't gone into math that would have been all right. Claire's done well for herself. I'm satisfied with her. I'm proud of you. . I don't mean to embarrass you. It's part of the reason we have children. We hope they'll survive us, accomplish what we can't. Now that I'm back in the game I admit I've got another idea, a better one. 
 CATHERINE: W 
 ROBERT: I know you've got your own work. I don't want you to neglect that. You can't neglect it. But I could probably use some help. Work with me. If you want to, if you can work ir out with your class schedule and everything else, I could help you with that, make some calls, talk to your teachers ... I'm getting ahead of myself. Well, Jesus, look, enough bullshit, you asked to see something. Lets start with this. I’ve roughed something out. General outline for a proof. Major result. Important. It's not finished but you can see where it's going. Let's see: (He selects a notebook.) Here. (He gives it to Catherine. She opens it and reads.) It's very rough. (After a long moment Catherine closes the notebook. A beat.) 
 CATHERINE: D L g i 
 ROBERT: The gaps might make it hard to follow. We can talk it through. 
 CATHERINE: Y c L g i 
 ROBERT: Maybe we could work on this together. This might be a great place to start. What about it? What do you think? Let's talk it through. 
 CATHERINE: N n I c t I r f o h L g i 
 ROBERT: I'm telling you it's stifling in there, goddamn it. The radiators. Look, read out the first couple of lines. That's how we start: You read, and we go line by line, out loud, through the argument. if there’s a better way, a shorter way. Let's collaborate. 
 CATHERINE: N C o 
 ROBERT: I've been waiting years for this. This is something I want to do. Come on, let's do some work together. 
 CATHERINE: W c d i o h I f c I t y i

 CLAIRE: It's all right, isn't it? We have a place where we buy all our coffee. They roast it themselves, they have an old roaster down in the basement. You can smell it on the street. Some mornings you can smell it from our place, four stories up. It's wonderful. "Manhattan's Best": Some magazine wrote it up. Who knows. But it is very good.

 CLAIRE: You slept all week I had to cancel my flight. I missed a week of work - I was this close to taking you to the hospital! I couldn't believe it when you finally dragged yourself up. 
 CATHERINE: I w t

 CLAIRE: You're the genius, figure it out. (Claire is upset, near tears. She digs in her bag, pulls out a plane ticket, throws it on the table. She exits. Catherine is alone. She can't quite bring herself to leave the porch. A moment. Hal enters - not through the house, from the side. He is badly dressed and looks very tired. He is breathless from running.) 
 HAL: You're still here. (Catherine is surprised. She doesn't speak.) I saw Claire leaving our front. I wasn't sure if you - (He holds up the notebook.) This fucking thing ... checks out. I have been over it, twice, with two different sets of guys, old geeks and young geeks. It is weird. I don't know where the techniques came from. Some of the moves are very hard to follow. But we can't find anything wrong with it! There might be something wrong with it but we can't find it. I have not slept. (He catches his breath.) It works. I thought you might want to know. 
 CATHERINE: I a k (b) 
 HAL: I had to swear these guys to secrecy. They were jumping out of their skins. See, one e-mail and it's all over. I threatened them. I think we're safe, they're physical cowards. (b) I had to see you. 
 CATHERINE: I l

 HAL: I don't think your father wrote it. (b) 
 CATHERINE: Y t s l w 
 HAL: That was last week. I spent this week reading the proof. I think I understand it, more or less. It uses a lot of newer mathematical techniques, things that were developed in the last decade. Elliptic Curves. Modular Forms. I think I learned more mathematics this week than I did in four years of grad school. 
 CATHERINE: S 
 HAL: So the proof is very ... hip. 
 CATHERINE: G s s H 
 HAL: What was your father doing the last ten years? He wasn't well, was he? 
 CATHERINE: A y d 
 HAL: I don't think he would have been able to master those new techniques. 
 CATHERINE: B h w a g 
 HAL: But he was nuts. 
 CATHERINE: S h r a t l 
 HAL: Maybe. The books he would have needed are upstairs. (b) Your dad dated everything. Even his most incoherent entries he dared. There are no dates in this. 
 CATHERINE: T h - 
 HAL: - looks like your dad's. Parents and children sometimes have similar handwriting, especially if they've spent a lot of time together. (b)

 CATHERINE: F i 
 HAL: I mean we have questions. Working on this must have been amazing. I'd love just to hear you talk about some of this. 
 CATHERINE: N 
 HAL: You'll have to deal with it eventually, you know. You can't ignore it, you'll have to get it published. You'll have to talk to someone. Take it, at least. Then I'll go. Here.
